The 1933 Griffith Park Fire was a fire that occurred in 1933 at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. Due to the deaths of 29 civilians who were trying to fight the fire, it remains one of the deadliest disasters for firefighters in the United States.
The Bel Air Fire was a disaster that began as a brush fire on November 5, 1961 in the Bel Air community of Los Angeles. 484 homes were destroyed and 16,090 acres were burned. The fire was fueled by a strong Santa Ana wind condition. Given the exclusive neighborhood's location in Los Angeles, there were multiple celebrities directly affected by the fire. Actors Burt Lancaster, Joan Fontaine, and Zsa Zsa Gabor, comedian Joe E. Brown, Nobel laureate chemist Willard Libby and composer Lukas Foss all lost homes from the fire. Others that fought flames before they evacuated were then-former Vice President Richard Nixon, actor Robert Taylor, film producer Keith Daniels and singer Billy Vaughn.
The 1978 Agoura-Malibu firestorm was a firestorm fueled by at least eight significant wildfires in the Los Angeles area on October 23, 1978. At around noon that day, an arsonist started a fire that eventually burned 25,000 acres from Cornell to Broad Beach in Malibu. The first fire alarm in Agoura was reported at 12:11 PM, and by 2:30 PM, the fire had reached the Pacific Ocean 13 miles south in Malibu. It had been declared a Level 2 (maximum emergency) fire at 1:57 PM.As the fires spread through the canyons of the Santa Monica Mountains over the next four days, a total of 230 homes were destroyed in Agoura and Malibu, and in the Los Angeles community of Mandeville Canyon to the east. At least 254 other structures were also destroyed. The fire was contained on October 25 and controlled on October 27. 136 engine companies, 28 camp crews, eight bulldozers, six helicopters and six fixed wing air tankers helped fight this fire.Known at the "Agoura-Malibu Firestorm" and the "Mandeville Canyon Fire", these two major fires were bolstered by winds as high as 60 MPH and extremely dry conditions. Residents of Agoura were evacuated to Whizin's Shopping Center in Agoura Hills, where massive flames could be seen engulfing Castro Peak.Damage caused by the group of fires burning throughout the area was estimated at $71.4 million, according to California officials. Three people were killed and 50 were injured, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.A 15-year-old Agoura youth was arrested for starting the fire, and sentenced to be confined in the California Youth Authority until his 21st birthday. Arson investigators determined that he had used a lit cigarette wrapped in a matchbook to set the fire.
The Laguna Fire, previously known as the Kitchen Creek Fire and the Boulder Oaks Fire, occurred in 1970 in eastern San Diego County, California of Southern California. It was the third largest wildfire in the history of California at that time, after the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 and the Matilija Fire of 1932. It was one of many wildfires in a massive conflagration that spanned across the state from September 22 – October 4, 1970.
The fire on the Lüneburg Heath was a major forest fire in 1975 on the southern part of the Lüneburg Heath in north Germany, with various points of origin near Gifhorn, Eschede and Meinersen. To this day, it is the largest known forest fire in the Federal Republic of Germany.
The Marble-Cone Fire was a wildland fire which burned for three weeks in August, 1977 in the Big Sur, California high country. By the time it was extinguished, it had burned about 178,000 acres (720 km2) in the Santa Lucia Mountains, known as the Ventana Wilderness, making it the largest wildfire in recorded California history at that time. The fire burned 90% of the vegetation cover in the upper Big Sur River watershed. This posed the threat of serious flooding in the Big Sur River Valley, where a much smaller August 1972 fire had led to disastrous flooding later that year. Fortunately, moderate rains resulted in no major flooding problems. Elite Fire crew Tahoe One headed by foreman Tom Hatcher and lead Pulaski Leonard Andrenacci were the point crew in the last defensive attempt to save the Ventana Wilderness. No mechanized equipment was allowed into the wilderness and the firefight was all done by hand line. The result was that the Ventana Wilderness was lost. Opening the debate whether mechanized equipment should be used in virgin forest during a wild land fire. Winds on the Marble Cone fire were One Hundred miles an hour plus, It was a true Fire Storm
The 1987 Daxing'anling wildfire (大兴安岭特大森林火灾), also known as the May 6 fire (5·6大火) was a major wildfire that began in the northeast Daxing'anling Prefecture Heilongjiang People's Republic of China on May 6, 1987. The burning lasted almost a month, when it was finally stopped on June 2, 1987. The fire covered about 10,000 square kilometres (2,500,000 acres) of which 6500 square kilometres was forestry. About 266 people were wounded and 211 died in the sea of fire with 50,000 left homeless.
The Mount Carmel forest fire was a forest fire that occurred between 19 and 22 September 1989 on Mount Carmel in northern Israel and was one of the largest forest fires in Israel, the largest being the Mount Carmel forest fire of 2010.The fire extended over 6,000 dunams (600 ha; 1,500 acres), of which 3,200 dunams (320 ha; 790 acres) were natural forest areas of Aleppo pine which were part of the Carmel National Park and Nature Reserve, causing considerable damage to the flora and wildlife.
The Yellowstone fires of 1988 together formed the largest wildfire in the recorded history of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread out of control with increasing winds and drought and combined into one large conflagration, which burned for several months. The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency personnel for the first time in its history. Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end. A total of 793,880 acres (3,213 km2), or 36 percent of the park was affected by the wildfires.Thousands of firefighters fought the fires, assisted by dozens of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft which were used for water and fire retardant drops. At the peak of the effort, over 9,000 firefighters were assigned to the park. With fires raging throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and other areas in the western United States, the staffing levels of the National Park Service and other land management agencies were inadequate for the situation; over 4,000 U.S. military personnel were soon brought in to assist in fire suppression efforts. The firefighting effort cost $120 million ($240 million in 2016). No firefighters died while fighting Yellowstone fires, though there were two fire-related deaths outside the park.Before the late 1960s, fires were generally believed to be detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible. However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.In contrast, in 1988, Yellowstone was overdue for a large fire, and, in the exceptionally dry summer, the many smaller "controlled" fires combined. The fires burned discontinuously, leaping from one patch to another, leaving intervening areas untouched. Large firestorms swept through some regions, burning everything in their paths. Tens of millions of trees and countless plants were killed by the wildfires, and some regions were left looking blackened and dead. However, more than half of the affected areas were burned by ground fires, which did less damage to hardier tree species. Not long after the fires ended, plant and tree species quickly reestablished themselves, and natural plant regeneration has been highly successful.The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were unprecedented in the history of the National Park Service, and many questioned existing fire management policies. Media accounts of mismanagement were often sensational and inaccurate, sometimes wrongly reporting or implying that most of the park was being destroyed. While there were temporary declines in air quality during the fires, no adverse long-term health effects have been recorded in the ecosystem and contrary to initial reports, few large mammals were killed by the fires, though there has been a reduction in the number of moose which has yet to rebound. Losses to structures were minimized by concentrating firefighting efforts near major visitor areas, keeping property damage down to $3 million ($6 million as of 2016).
The 1996–97 Australian bushfire season was the season for bushfires in Australia over the summer of 1996–1997. The most prominent fires during the season were in the Dandenong Ranges and the Mornington Peninsula in the state of Victoria.
The Dome Fire was a destructive wildfire in the Jemez Mountains in the northern portion of the U.S. state of New Mexico. Devastating portions of the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier National Monument, the fire exploded on April 26, 1996, starting from an improperly extinguished campfire and continued until 16,516 acres (66.8 km²) in Capulin Canyon and the Dome Wilderness were burned. High fuel loading, low fuel moisture, and wind contributed to the extremely rapid spread of the fire, with flame lengths of hundreds of feet. The fire was contained in early May, 1996 after being fought by over 900 firefighters. The Dome Fire was significant for pointing out the problems of fighting fires on the Pajarito Plateau and was the immediate inspiration for creation of the Interagency Wildfire Management Team.
The Mount Vision Fire was a wildfire that burned 12,354 acres (50 km2) of land on the Point Reyes National Seashore peninsula in northern California during October 1995. The fire, which was started by an incompletely extinguished campfire, destroyed 45 homes in Inverness Park.
The Oakland firestorm of 1991 was a large suburban wildland-urban interface conflagration that occurred on the hillsides of northern Oakland, California, and southeastern Berkeley on October 20, 1991. The official name of this incident by Cal Fire is the Tunnel fire. However, it is also commonly referred to as Oakland hills firestorm or the East Bay Hills Fire. The fire ultimately killed 25 people and injured 150 others. The 1,520 acres (620 ha) destroyed, included 2,843 single-family dwellings and 437 apartment and condominium units. The economic loss has been estimated at $1.5 billion.
The Oso Complex Fire started June 20, 1998 and burned 5,185 acres (21 km²) in the Santa Fe National Forest in the Jemez Mountains, including more than 1,200 acres (4.9 km²) of Santa Clara Pueblo land. The fire came within 8 miles (13 km) of Los Alamos, New Mexico and was contained by July 6, 1998, aided by rain. The cause of the fire was determined to be arson.
The 1996 Pat Sin Leng wildfire was a wildfire in Pat Sin Leng, Tai Po, New Territories, Hong Kong on 10 February, 1996 (Saturday). It was the worst wildfire in local history. The disaster killed three students and two teachers at the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Club Fung Yiu King Memorial Secondary School and injured a further 13 students.The Hong Kong Government built a "Spring Breeze Pavilion" on Pat Sin Leng to commemorate the two teachers who died saving the students in the tragedy.After the disaster, the area was no longer suitable for vegetation growth, therefore suffers from soil erosion.
The South Canyon Fire was a 1994 wildfire that took the lives of 14 wildland firefighters on Storm King Mountain, near Glenwood Springs, Colorado, on July 6, 1994. It is often also referred to as the "Storm King" fire.It was the subject of John Maclean's book Fire on the Mountain: The True Story of the South Canyon Fire.
The Cerro Grande Fire was a disastrous forest fire in New Mexico, United States of America, that occurred in May 2000. The fire started as a controlled burn, and became uncontrolled owing to high winds and drought conditions. Over 400 families in the town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, lost their homes in the resulting 48,000-acre (190 km²) fire. Structures at Los Alamos National Laboratory were also destroyed or damaged, although without loss or destruction of any of the special nuclear material housed there. Amazingly, there was no loss of human life. The US General Accounting Office estimated total damages at $1 billion.
The Kate's Basin Fire is a wildfire complex which began burning southwest of Thermopolis and north of Riverton in Hot Springs County, Wyoming. The fire complex started as the Kate's Basin and Blondie #2 fires on August 7, 2000 and by August 18, it had burned over 137,600 acres (556.8 km2). The fire started as a result of lightning.During the fighting of the fire a burn over incident resulted in the death of James (Jim) Burnett of Hatfield, Arkansas, the Engine Boss of Oklahoma Engine #2.
The 2000 Table Mountain Fire was a number of large veld fire that burned in and around the Table Mountain National Park in Cape Town, South Africa from 16 January to 20 January 2000. Over 120 fires were reported to have started around the Cape metropolitan area and spread rapidly due to dry and windy conditions on the 16 January 2000.By the time the last fire was put out on the 20 January 2000 over 10,000 ha had been burned across the Western Cape with 8,000 ha burned in the South Peninsula alone. It is estimated that fire caused around US$500 million in insurance claims alone . Over 70 houses and 200 informal dwellings were damaged or destroyed. Over 1,200 firefighters and other official and volunteer personal were involved in fighting the fire at a cost of $3 million.
The 2000-2001 Western United States wildfires were a series of unusually severe wildfires that caused more than $2 billion (USD) in damage and resulted in the deaths of four firefighters. The damage was particularly severe in the Bitterroot National Forest. One of the most stunning photos from these fires are two elk seeking shelter in the East Fork of the Bitterroot River. The photo became known as Elk Bath.
The Thirtymile Fire started as an escaped picnic cooking fire on July 9, 2001, in the Chewuch River canyon, approximately 30 miles north of the town of Winthrop, on the Okanogan National Forest in the state of Washington. On the evening of July 9, the Libby South Fire was already burning 50 miles (80 km) to the south, and this fire exceeded 1,000 acres (4.0 km2). To the north on the Thirtymile Fire, four firefighters were killed in the fire: Tom Craven, Karen FitzPatrick, Jessica Johnson, and Devin Weaver.
The 2001 Warragamba bushfires occurred Christmas Day, 25 December 2001 in the small New South Wales town of Warragamba, leaving 30 homes and businesses destroyed.The bushfires in Warragamba were part of the longest official continuous bushfire emergency in NSW taking place between 21 December 2001 and 13 January 2002 and spreading across the state. Most of these fires were caused by lightning or arsonists. The fire behaviour was unusual in many areas due to extreme dryness of fuel and variable winds. The initial destruction in Warragamba and the Hawkesbury River area prompted a natural disaster declaration by the State Government.On Christmas Day of 2001 over four thousand firefighters were battling over one hundred blazes across the state. A band of fire running from Campbelltown, New South Wales east to the coast was the firefighters main concern. This was the firefront that caused the damage to Warragamba and neighbouring town Silverdale, New South Wales as the fire sped sixty kilometres in six hours from the Lower Blue Mountains to the coast around Helensburgh, New South Wales. Areas further south, such as the area around St. George's Basin and Jervis Bay were heavily affected by fires caused by stray embers from the main front, with many homes in the area being destroyed.Many local residents of the townships under threat battled the fires with garden hoses, as there were not enough fire-fighters. One resident, Father John Evans battled to save the local parish church, only to see his own house burn down.Hundreds of people were forced into an emergency evacuation from Warragamba.The initial loss of electricity affected 4,500 homes in Warragamba and surrounding areas. The local electricity supplier, Integral Energy estimated the cost in the Warragamba and surrounding areas at 3 million dollars.On 26 December 2001, the day after the fires swept through the town, Prime Minister John Howard visited the town and praised the work of volunteer firefighters.
The 2002–03 Australian bushfire season was a particularly extensive bushfire season in Australia. It ran predominantly from December 2002 to March 2003 and involved over 3,000 separate fires in Victoria alone. The 2003 Canberra bushfires were also particularly severe.The developing drought in Australia and well below-average rainfall through winter and spring of 2002 established conditions conducive to above-average bushfire potential. During the 2002–03 season, there were 5,999 bushfires attended by the relevant agency Australia-wide and 7 fatalities, 4 of those from the January Canberra fires.Perhaps the most well known fire of the season was the Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires that burnt in north-eastern Victoria, the Victorian Alps and Gippsland. This fire was ignited in several locations by multiple lightning strikes and burnt 1.12 million hectares of land over the course of 2 months. Over 15,000 personnel were directly engaged with this fire complex.
The Biscuit Fire was a wildfire that took place in 2002 that burned nearly 500,000 acres (2,000 km²) in the Siskiyou National Forest in southern Oregon and northern California, in the Western United States. The fire was named after Biscuit Creek in southern Oregon.
The Biscuit Fire publication controversy was an academic and political controversy in the United States in January 2006 about publication of an academic paper titled Post-wildfire logging hinders regeneration and increases fire risk. The U.S Forest Service and a group of professors, including six at the Oregon State University College of Forestry, wrote a letter to the prestigious scientific journal Science requesting that publication of a short forestry paper written by an OSU Forestry graduate student and others be delayed until the authors could respond to it, arguing the article was "short on qualifiers and context". The group requested alternatively that Science publish a sidebar illustrating their concerns alongside the paper. Science refused, and the paper, which had already undergone peer review and been approved for publication, appeared in the January 20, 2006 issue. The paper had been published in the online edition of Science before the letter was written.
The Hayman fire was a forest fire that started 95 miles (153 km) southwest of Denver, Colorado and 35 miles (56 km) northwest of Colorado Springs on June 8, 2002, and became the largest of the Colorado wildfires in the state's recorded history. Hundreds of firefighters fought the fast-moving fire, which caused nearly $40 million in firefighting costs, burned 133 homes, 138,114 acres, and forced the evacuation of 5,340 people. Smoke could be seen and smelled across the state from Vail, 108 miles (174 km) northwest, to Burlington, 188 miles (303 km) east, and from Broomfield, 50 miles (80 km) north, to Walsenburg, 130 miles (210 km) south. The fire wasn't contained until July 2, 2002 and was finally brought under control on July 18, 2002. The cause of the wildfire was found to be arson.When then-Governor Bill Owens responded to a reporter’s question following an aerial tour of the fires ("What does it look like up there?"), Owens said "It looks as if all of Colorado is burning today." Many western slope residents blamed Owens for driving away tourists with the press's truncated version of the quote ("All of Colorado is burning.") The Hayman fire was named for a mining ghost town near Tappan Gulch.
The Rodeo–Chediski Fire was a wildfire that burned in east-central Arizona beginning on June 18, 2002, and was not controlled until July 7. It was the worst forest fire in Arizona's recorded history until June 14, 2011 when the Wallow Fire surpassed Rodeo-Chediski as the largest fire in Arizona history. Several local communities, including Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, Heber-Overgaard Claysprings and Pinedale, were threatened and had to be evacuated.
The Aspen Fire burned from June 17, 2003 for about a month on Mount Lemmon, part of the Santa Catalina Mountains located in the Coronado National Forest north of Tucson, Arizona, and in the surrounding area. It burned 84,750 acres (343.0 km2) (132.4 sq mi) of land, and destroyed 340 homes and businesses of the town of Summerhaven.Damages to electric lines, phone lines, water facilities, streets and sewers totaled $4.1 million. Firefighting cost was about $17 million, and the Forest Service is spending $2.7 million to prevent soil loss.In 2002, the year before the fire started, Congress had been requested to allocate about $2,000,000 to cover the implementation of fire prevention measures in the Coronado National Forest. However, that allocation was reduced to about $150,000 in the Congressional budget process.
The B&B Complex Fires were a linked pair of wildfires that together burned 90,769 acres (367.33 km2) of Oregon forest during the summer of 2003. The fire complex began as two separate fires, the Bear Butte Fire and the Booth Fire. The two fires were reported on the same day and eventually burned together, forming a single fire area that stretched along the crest of the Cascade Mountains between Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington. On the western side of the Cascades, the fire consumed mostly Douglas-fir and western hemlock. On the eastern side of the mountains, the fire burned mostly Ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, and jack pine. Most of the burned area was on public land administered by the United States Forest Service including 40,419 acres (163.57 km2) within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness. The fire also burned forest land on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation and small areas of state and private land. Firefighters battled the blaze for 34 days. At the peak of the firefighting effort, there were over 2,300 personnel working on the fire. The cost of fire suppression was over $38 million.
The 2003 Canberra bushfires involved several deaths, over 490 injured, and caused severe damage to the outskirts of Canberra, the capital city of Australia, during 18–22 January 2003. Almost 70% of the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) pastures, forests (pine plantations), and nature parks were severely damaged, and most of the renowned Mount Stromlo Observatory was destroyed. After burning for a week around the edges of the ACT, the fires entered the suburbs of Canberra on 18 January 2003. Over the next ten hours, four people died and more than 500 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, requiring a significant relief and reconstruction effort.
The Cedar Fire was a wildfire which burned a large area of land in San Diego County, California in October 2003. The Cedar Fire was one of 15 wildfires burning throughout Southern California during that month, which became known as the "2003 Firestorm" and the "Fire Siege of 2003." The October 2003 California wildfires were estimated to have burned a total of 800,000 acres (3,200 km2). The Cedar Fire was the largest wildfire in recorded California history, with the possible exception of the Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889.
The Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires, started with eighty seven fires that were started by lightning in the north east of Victoria on 8 January 2003. Eight of these fires were unable to be contained and joined together to form the largest fire in Victoria since the 1939 "Black Friday" bushfires.The main fire burnt over 13,000 km² over 59 days before it was contained on 7 March 2003. 41 homes were destroyed and over 9,000 livestock killed. Thousands of kilometres of fencing was also destroyed. This was the longest running fire until the 2006-07 Great Divide fires.In early February, at the peak of the fires, around 3,760 people were involved in the fire effort, excluding local CFA brigades. This figure includes 160 Defence Force staff, over 300 interstate firefighters, 33 alpine firefighting specialists from New Zealand and 35 personnel from the United States. In total, 15,725 personnel were directly engaged on fighting these bushfires.The areas affected included, Mount Buffalo, Mount Bogong, Mount Feathertop, Bright, Dinner Plain, Benambra, Omeo, Cobungra, Shannonvale, Bundara, Anglers Rest, Sunnyside, Glen Wills, and Dargo.
On August 16, 2003, a wildfire was started near Rattlesnake Island in Okanagan Mountain Provincial Park in British Columbia, Canada. The wildfire was fuelled by a constant wind and one of the driest summers in the past decade. Within a few days it had grown into a true firestorm.The fire grew northward and eastward, initially threatening a small number of lakeshore homes, but quickly became an interface zone fire and forced the evacuation of 27,000 residents and consumed 239 homes. The final size of the firestorm was over 250 square kilometers (25,912 hectares (64,030 acres)). Most of the trees in Okanagan Mountain Park were burned, and the park was closed.60 fire departments, 1,400 armed forces troops and 1,000 forest fire fighters took part in controlling the fire, but were largely helpless in stopping the disaster.There were also at least 3 Air Spray (1967) Ltd. owned Canadair CL-215s, 4 Government of Alberta owned Canadair CL-215s, 4 Air Spray (1967) Ltd. owned Lockheed L188 Electra airtankers and at least one Martin Mars air tanker working the fire. Tragically, one air tanker and one helicopter crashed, killing three firefighters Amateur radio operators helped pass emergency traffic during this emergency. That cost was estimated at CAD $33.8 million.
The 2004 Alaska fire season was the worst on record in terms of area burned by wildfires in the U.S. state of Alaska. Though there were fewer fires than in 1989 when almost 1,000 were recorded, more than 6,600,000 acres (27,000 km2) were burned by 701 fires. The largest of these fires was the Taylor Complex Fire. This fire consumed over 1,700,000 acres (6,900 km2) and was the deemed to be the largest fire in the United States from 1997 to 2007. Out of all 701 fires, 426 fires were started by humans and 215 by lightning.
The Taylor Complex Fire was a 2004 wildfire in Alaska that consumed approximately 1,305,592 acres (5,284 km2) of land. By acreage, it was the largest wildfire in the United States between 1997-2007. The fire also was part of the record-breaking 2004 Alaska fire season that burned more than 6,600,000 acres (27,000 km2), the most in recorded history.
The 2005–06 Australian bushfire season was a moderately extensive bushfire season, particularly in western Victoria where they were most prominent in mid-late January 2006 as conditions permitted across the state. On Australia Day, a CFA volunteer died in the Victorian fires.
The Cave Creek Complex fire was the third largest wildfire in the state of Arizona to date, after the Rodeo-Chediski fire and Wallow Fire.
In January 2005, Eyre Peninsula, South Australia, was the scene of a devastating bushfire in which nine people were killed and at least 113 injured. It was one of Australia’s worst bushfires since the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983. The fire began in farmland north of the town of Wangary and spread to the east. Investigation confirmed that the cause was a faulty muffler on a vehicle parked in grass on a roadside by a man checking the suitability of an area for prospecting with a metal detector. investigations confirmed that it was not arson. It burnt more than 82,000 hectares of farm and scrubland in and around the small townships of Wangary, Wanilla, North Shields, Poonindie, Louth Bay, Greenpatch, and Yallunda Flat near Port Lincoln.More than $100 million los included 79 houses completely destroyed, 26 houses suffering extensive damage, 139 vehicles destroyed, 324 sheds destroyed or severely damaged, 138 farm implements destroyed, 6.300 km of fencing destroyed, 46,500 head of stock killed, one aircraft ($100,000) destroyed, tools ands equipment of 46 small businesses/contractors lost. This does not include the human impact of loss, injury and dislocation, or the loss of possessions, clothing, even school books before the new school year about to resume.1,290 people suffered loss of property because of the fire.The Eyre Peninsula Bushfire of January 2005 were later called the "Black Tuesday" fires, they resulted in much damage to property and even more damage to locals' lives. The fire began on 10 January, and was initially contained by emergency services. However, severe weather conditions on 11 January, with wind speeds of 70 km/h and temperatures exceeding 40 degrees, then caused the fire to break through containment lines and spread to the east.More than 400 South Australian Country Fire Service fire fighters and 80 fire appliances combated the fire, with assistance from local property owners. The Port Lincoln airport was temporarily closed, preventing additional fire fighters from being flown in from Adelaide. A major emergency was declared for the Eyre Peninsula from noon on 12 January until 16 January.As the fire tore through North Shields, a small settlement north of Port Lincoln, residents were ordered to leave their homes and head to the beaches to the east. The blaze raged through the caravan park at North Shields, destroying cabins and caravans. Residents at Louth Bay were forced to evacuate and seek refuge on nearby beaches. Some residents had to be rescued from the sea by emergency services after taking refuge in the water.Six people, including four children, died in their cars as they tried to flee the firestorm. Two others died when the vehicle from which they were fighting the fire was engulfed by flame. A local schoolteacher also died when flames engulfed the Shell Museum at North Shields north of Port Lincoln. 113 were reported injured, including five who suffered serious burns and were flown to Adelaide for treatment. Several people were treated at Port Lincoln Hospital for burns and smoke inhalation. The fire was contained on 12 January after burning for two days.Property damage included 15 caravans, two buses, three cabins, one shop, three vans and four boats. There was also extensive damage to rural infrastructure, including water mains, power lines and telephone infrastructure.
The School Fire was a wildfire that occurred in the US state of Washington in August 2005. The fire originated in the Umatilla National Forest in southeastern Washington, in Columbia and Garfield Counties. The School Fire was detected from space by NASA's Terra satellite. The fire burned around 51,892.13 acres (81.08 sq mi; 21,000 ha), destroying over 100 houses and 100 outbuildings. The largest wildfire of 2005 in the contiguous United States, the School Fire's smoke was seen as far away as Walla Walla. Its total damage was estimated at $15 million.
The Texas-Oklahoma wildfires of 2005–06 were a series of wildfires, primarily in the states of Texas and Oklahoma, that began November 27, 2005 and continued into April 2006. Surrounding states were also affected to a lesser extent.The fires were triggered by a combination of record-high temperatures, drought, and high winds in the region. The situation was exacerbated, at least in Texas, by plentiful rains in recent years. The rains encouraged vegetation growth, which then dried out over the winter drought leaving more potential fuel. The unusually dry conditions have been attributed to La Niña.[1] At Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, only 0.36 inches (9.1 mm) of rain fell in the first two months of the year.[2] On January 1, fires continued to develop throughout the two states. By January 3, many of the fires were reported to be under control; but outbreaks continued through January, February, and March.In Texas, 11 people were killed. Eight Texas towns were evacuated in March 2006.[3] From December 26, 2005 to April 3, 2006, Texas suffered 11,048 wildfires which burned 4,903,851 acres (19,845 km2) and destroyed 423 homes.[4] In Oklahoma, 869 homes were damaged; 300 of them were destroyed.[5] As of April 5, 2006, there had been over 22,564 wildfires across the country in the year to date, burning 1,872,701 acres (7,579 km2).[6]Texas governor Rick Perry declared the entire state a disaster area, describing it as a "tinderbox", and called for firefighters and fire equipment to combat the blazes.[7] In addition, the governor of Oklahoma, Brad Henry, declared a disaster and pleaded for federal aid. On January 10, President Bush declared several Oklahoma counties to be disaster areas; the list was amended to include 26 counties by late March.Heavy rains in late March promised at least temporary relief to the affected areas. Governor Henry lifted the burn ban (which had been instated in November) throughout Oklahoma on March 22, but reinstated it for most counties only five days later, on March 27.[8] Much of Texas was also placed under a burn ban.
The 2006–07 Australian bushfire season was one of the most extensive bushfire seasons in Australia's history. Victoria experienced the longest continuously burning bushfire complex in Australia's history, with fires in the Victorian Alps and Gippsland burning over 1 million hectares of land over the course of 69 days. See Bushfires in Australia for an explanation of regional seasons.The 2006–07 season included the Victorian Alpine Fire Complex which was the longest running collection of bushfires in Victoria's history. On 1 December 2006, more than 70 fires were caused by lightning strikes in the Victorian Alps, many of which eventually merged to become the Great Divide Complex, which burned for 69 days across about a million hectares.Despite the length of the season and amount of land burnt, the fires were contained to mostly unoccupied regions such as the Victorian Alps, national parks and remnant bushland. Evacuation plans were implemented in many small towns in these areas, a combination of these factors resulted in only one fatality as a result of the fires.
Pulletop bushfire started on the 6 February 2006 in hot dry and windy weather conditions about 30 km southeast of Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. The fire was thought to have been started by sparks from a tractor on a property at Pulletop which quickly got out of control. New South Wales Rural Fire Service declared a bushfire emergency and the Hume Highway was closed late in the afternoon with fears that the fire would threaten the towns of Humula, Book Book, Livingstone and Kyeamba after 10 km² of farmland was burnt. 7 February 2006 milder conditions help firefighters to control the fire burning in inaccessible country.Over 90 km² of farmland burnt2,500 sheep killed6 cattle killed3 vehicles destroyed2 hay sheds destroyed50km of fencing was burntPine plantation worth $5 million, a communications installation and 19 homes savedA Natural Disaster was declared
The Table Mountain fire was a large fire in and around the Table Mountain National Park in Cape Town, South Africa. It broke out at approximately 4 p.m. on 26 January 2006 above Tafelberg Road, and spread quickly due to dry conditions and strong winds of up to 60 knots (110 km/h; 69 mph). It threatened to spread into the densely populated suburbs of Tamboerskloof, Oranjezicht, Vredehoek and Gardens on the north side, as well as Camps Bay and Bantry Bay on the south side.Janet Chesworth, a 65-year-old British tourist, died from smoke inhalation while hiking near the lower cable station along with her daughter, Linda, who was in an unknown condition. A group of three German tourists were found unharmed on the mountain, and two tourists were also airlifted off the mountain while they waited on a rock near the upper cable car station. Up to sixteen hikers were also reportedly stranded on Table Mountain and Signal Hill. A number of homes were destroyed, as well as three cars along Tafelberg Road. An estimated 7 km² of fynbos vegetation was destroyed on the first day of the blaze and, according to conservation officials, approximately 40 to 50% of the world's Silver leaf tree population — found only in Stellenbosch, Paarl, Lion's Head and the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden — had perished in the blaze.Three helicopters from Working on Fire, a government-private poverty alleviation initiative, waterbombed the blaze for most of the afternoon of the 26th, but had to leave the area as darkness fell. At that time, the fire was being fought by 150 firefighters and twenty reserve firefighters as well as volunteer wildfire specialists from the Volunteer Wildfire Services. On the morning of 27 January, waterbombing by six helicopters aided by a spotter plane resumed when daylight returned, and the fire was seemingly under control by early morning. More than one hundred firefighters worked through the night to contain the blaze, with the abating winds helping speed the process.However, in the early evening of the 27th the wind picked up, fanning hotspots still left over and by nightfall the mountain was ablaze, and, despite extra firefighters brought in from as far afield as Clanwilliam and Mpumalanga, a long night's work was predicted for emergency personnel.Around 4:30 a.m. on the 28th the fire severed an electrical main line that supplied some of the higher-lying suburbs, leaving them without electricity until late the afternoon. By this time, firefighters also reported that the fire was completely under control. With the wind keeping low during the night, no additional flare-ups occurred.Many citizens of Cape Town supported the firefighters with refreshments and in one case, fuel.A 36-year-old British man, Anthony Cooper of Gowerton, was arrested on the 26th after allegedly discarding a burning cigarette butt from his car after stopping on the mountain. In addition to being charged with arson, he faces a culpable homicide charge after the death of the British tourist. The City of Cape Town noted its intention to pursue a civil claim against Cooper.On 23 May, after he failed to appear for an unrelated charge of driving under the influence two days before the fire, magistrate Ingrid Freitag issued a warrant for Cooper's arrest and provisionally forfeited his bail. Cooper claimed that he had phoned the national emergency number when he realized a fire had started, allegedly through his own actions.In January 2008, Cooper was found not guilty of causing the fire, on the basis of reasonable doubt.
The Tatoosh Fire began in Washington on August 22, 2006. It was sparked by lightning and in September 2006, it moved across the border into British Columbia. As of September 10, 2006, it was still out of control and burning in E. C. Manning Provincial Park. At that time, it had already burned 4,000 hectares before rain finally brought the fire season to an end. The fire ultimately burned 47,787 acres (19,339 ha) in Washington and British Columbia, and the overall Tatoosh Complex burned 51,671 acres (20,911 ha).
The 2007–08 Australian bushfire season was the Australian bushfire season over the summer of 2007–2008. Fire occurrence was below average for the season as some regions experienced increased rainfall and reduced fuel as a result of extensive fires during the previous 2006–07 season, particularly in Victoria where the fires in the 2006–07 season burnt over 1.1 million hectares of land. Fires in Victoria during the 2007–08 season burnt less than a fifth of the land area usually burnt during an average bushfire season.An analysis of bushfires in Victoria on public land by the Department of Sustainability and Environment revealed that the 2007–08 fires burnt 32,368 hectares, or 18.7% of the long-term average of 173,152 hectares. It was also estimated that 26% of these fires were caused by lightning strikes and 25% by arson.
The Bugaboo Scrub Fire was a wildfire that raged from April to June 2007 and ultimately became the largest fire in the history of both Georgia and Florida. The Bugaboo, which was not actually named until it had blazed for nearly a month, started in the Okefenokee Swamp, most of which is located in Georgia. It was previously known as the Sweat Farm Road Fire.
The Caribou Hills Fire was a 2007 wildfire that burned near Ninilchik, Alaska, and expanded extremely rapidly, making it at one point the top firefighting priority in the United States. It soon moved toward the town and at its peak threatened approximately 300 structures.
The 2007 Croatian coast fires were a series of fires that struck the Croatian coast in the summer of 2007. After a heat wave, which covered the entire Southern and Eastern Europe, the drought and southern wind helped spread the fires all over the Croatian coast, destroying a large part of the fragile plant and animal life.There were 750 fires on the coast from June 1 to August 8. They burned in the Istria County, the Zadar County, the Šibenik-Knin County, the Split-Dalmatia County and the Dubrovnik-Neretva County. The total burned area covered 159,000 hectares.The police indicted 18 persons and arrested 12 persons for arson. Those arrested included an unnamed 56-year-old suspected of setting seven fires and some shepherds who burned grass for sheep. When fires broke out in the region of Dubrovnik, the local authorities accused the Bosnian town of Trebinje of deliberately setting fires.
The 2007 Greek forest fires were a series of massive forest fires that broke out in several areas across Greece throughout the summer of 2007. The most destructive and lethal infernos broke out on 23 August, expanded rapidly and raged out of control until 27 August, until they were put out in early September. The fires mainly affected western and southern Peloponnese as well as southern Euboea. The death toll in August alone stood at 67 people. In total 84 people lost their lives because of the fires, including several fire fighters.Some of these firestorms are believed to be the result of arson while others were merely the result of negligence. Hot temperatures, including three consecutive heat waves of over 40 °C (105 °F), and severe drought rendered the 2007 summer unprecedented in modern Greek history. From the end of June to early September, over 3,000 forest fires were recorded across the nation. Nine more people were killed in blazes in June and July.A total of 2,700 square kilometers (670,000 acres) of forest, olive groves and farmland were destroyed in the fires, which was the worst fire season on record in the past 50 years. Of the total of 2,700 km², 1,500 km² (370,000 acres) were burnt forests in Southern Greece alone. Many buildings were also destroyed in the blaze. The fire destroyed 1,000 houses and 1,100 other buildings, and damaged hundreds more.
The Kangaroo Island bushfires were a series of bushfires caused by lightning strikes on 6 December 2007 on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, resulting in 95,000 ha of land being destroyed. The fires occurred mainly across the western side of the island near Flinders Chase National Park, Vivonne Bay, D'Estrees Bay, Western River and Riverleas.The D'Estrees Bay fire in Cape Gantheaume Conservation Park was contained by 12 December 2007, while intense fires in the west, which included the protected areas of Flinders Chase National Park and Ravine des Casoars Wilderness Protection Area, were more difficult to extinguish.On 14 December 2007, the Country Fire Service officially announced that all fires were contained. The event was South Australia's largest bush fire operation to date with over 800 personnel, 7 fixed wing water bombers and an Elvis Skycrane Helitanker all assisting in firefighting efforts, together with units from Victoria's Country Fire Authority and the Rural Fire Service of New South Wales.
The Milford Flat Fire was the largest wildfire in Utah history. It was started by lightning on Friday, July 6, 2007 at 3:45 pm near Milford, Utah. The fire burned 363,052 acres (567 square miles) and caused large stretches of I-15 to be temporarily closed. Many veteran firefighters had stated this was the fastest-moving fire they had ever seen.On Saturday, July 7, smoke caused numerous wrecks on I-15, including a 5-car pile-up, and a fatal hit-and-run that killed 2 motorcyclists from California. The fire also caused 10 truckers to abandon their cargo trailers on the side of the road. A 93-mile (150 km) stretch of I-15 was later closed. The fire crossed the freeway around Cove Fort that afternoon, causing it to be evacuated. The fire narrowly missed the local Chevron gas station, but claimed 2 garage-like structures near it, including the Dog Valley Trading Post, as well as a crew cab pickup truck left in a Park-and-Ride lot. By that evening the fire had amassed to 160,000 acres (650 km2).On Sunday, July 8, the fire slowed down somewhat, reaching the 283,000-acre (1,145 km2) mark by evening. The freeway was reopened, but later a 60-mile (97 km) stretch was closed for 5 hours. Also, FEMA announced the appropriation of federal funds to help fight the fire. Some evacuated residents of Cove Fort returned to view the damage.On July 9, Firefighters were going to backburn parts of I-15, but the winds changed, and the plans were canceled. More crews arrived, bringing the total personnel from 200 to about 300 firefighters. By the end of the day, the fire had grown to 311,000 acres (1,259 km2), but was 10% contained.July 10, more firefighters arrived, bringing the total to 400. The fire grew to 329,000 acres (1,331 km2), and was 30% contained by days end.July 15, the fire reached 100% containment.
The Neola North Fire was a major wildfire which occurred in the Ashley National Forest in northeastern Utah. It was blamed for three fatalities, the destruction of at least 12 homes, the burning of 43,511 acres (176 km2) of land, and led to the evacuation of about 500 local residents.At its peak the wildfire was fought by more than 700 firefighters, and gained extensive media attention in the United States and limited attention internationally.
The Sleeper Lake Fire was a wildfire that occurred north of the Village of Newberry in Luce County, Michigan. The fire most likely started with a lightning strike on August 2, 2007 near Sleeper Lake.
The 2008–09 Australian bushfire season was the Australian bushfire season that ran from late December 2008 to April/May 2009. Above average rainfalls in December, particularly in Victoria, delayed the start of the season, but by January 2009, conditions throughout South eastern Australia worsened with the onset of one of the region's worst heat waves. On 7 February, extreme bushfire conditions precipitated major bushfires throughout Victoria, involving several large fire complexes, which continued to burn across the state for around one month. 173 people lost their lives in these fires and 414 were injured. 3,500+ buildings were destroyed, including 2,029 houses, and 7,562 people displaced.Late 2008 had relatively few bushfires. Victoria in particular experienced higher than average rainfall in December, decreasing the fire danger in many regions of the state. Initial observations in October 2008 predicted an above average fire potential across Australia's coastal regions and a below average potential in Central Australia, where drought has reduced the available fuel.In late January and early February, the effects of the 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave increased temperatures across south-eastern Australia, particularly in Victoria and South Australia, where several locations broke all time temperature records. Various days of high wind speed, combined with the hot dry conditions, created extreme bushfire conditions between 25 January and 7 February 2009.
The 2008 Borjomi wildfires started in the Borjomi Gorge, Georgia on August 15, 2008 and lasted for several days to come, destroying 250 hectares (620 acres) of the 75,000 hectares (190,000 acres) Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park, one of the largest national parks in Europe.The fire started in the concluding days of the hostilities during the 2008 South Ossetia war, some 80 km far from the conflict area. Eyewitnesses reported camouflage-painted helicopters in the sky just before the fire erupted. Georgia accused Russia of bombing the area and deliberating starting a fire using incendiary devices, describing it as an ecocide. Russia's Defence Ministry denied bombing the forests and said that they would help the Georgians extinguish the fires if requested. Despite Turkish and Ukrainian aid, the firefighting efforts were complicated by the ongoing conflict and airspace restrictions.According to the government of Georgia,"the fire spread to over 950 hectares of forest land. An area of 250 hectares was totally destroyed, and 150 000 m³ of standing trees were lost. As a result, the forest's ecosystem lost its ecological function, as well as commercial value. In the affected area, endemic and other species were almost completely destroyed, including Himalayan yew, spruce, abies, pine, beech, oak, hornbeam and many varieties of forest wildlife.... The fauna of the region experienced significant damage as well."The Borjomi wildfire alarmed international environmental organizations. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called on "all parties capable of helping put out forest fires in central Georgia to work together to extinguish them." The PAN Parks network, of which the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park is a member, sent a latter to the Russian Minister of Natural Resources, expressing its concerns that the "recent bombing in Borjomi district resulted in a forest fire, which threatens Borjomi Kharagauli National Park." The World Bank expressed its "grave concern the reports of forest fires in the Borjomi area of Georgia" and sent an assessment team in the area. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe-UNEP mission will also assess the damage caused by fire, including in the Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park and adjacent forested areas.
The Cold Springs Fire started July 12, 2008, eleven miles north of Trout Lake in Washington. It was contained and put out in August 2008.The fire was started by lightning on July 12 and spread rapidly through heavy dead timber, eventually burning a total of 7,993 acres before full containment was reached on August 1. Of the area burned, 4,723 acres were in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 1,623 on the Yakima Indian Reservation, 1,076 on land managed by the Washington Department of Natural Resources, and 307 on privately owned lands. At the peak of firefighting efforts, over 1,000 personnel were assigned to combat the blaze. In total, 1,037 firefighters from 33 units were needed to reach containment.The fire neared Mount Adams as it spread north of Trout Lake causing closings for several trails and camp grounds. Fire officials said it was the largest fire the area had received in decades, and the dangerous fire conditions allowed it to grow and spread quickly through dead trees and winds up to 25 mph. However, people were expecting a large fire and had been preparing so that no homes or people were threatened in the event. Although no structures were burned, a 1909 historic guard station had to be wrapped in fire-retardant material.
The Evans Road Wildfire was a smoldering peat fire in Eastern North Carolina that started on June 1, 2008 by lightning strike during North Carolina's drought - the worst on record.It burned 41,534 acres (168.08 km2) inside the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge and burned for three months. The wildlife refuge is located in the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula, where many forest fires are prone to start because of several ecological factors. The area is densely populated by trees, which makes it easy for fires to spread quickly; a layer of shrubs and dead plant material on the ground serve as fuel for fires. Under this layer, the pocosin soil is high in organic material, which acts as a charcoal-like substance that helps fires start.450 firefighters battled it. 71 high capacity pumps moved billions of gallons of water.
The Trigo Fire was a disastrous wildfire in New Mexico, United States of America that occurred during April and May 2008. It affected the communities of Manzano, Torreon and Tajique, burned 59 homes and over 21 square miles (54 km2). The fire was discovered the morning of 15 April 2008, approximately ten miles east of Belen, and had already burned some 200 acres (0.81 km2) on the western slopes of the Manzano Mountains. The fire was 100% contained on 11 May 2008 and the last smoke sighted and extinguished was on 22 May. The US Forest Service said that the fire would not be completely out until snow blanketed the area in December.
The 2009–10 Australian bushfire season was the bushfire season which occurred predominantly from June 2009 to May 2010. Increased attention has been given to this season as authorities and government attempt to preempt any future loss of life after the Black Saturday bushfires during the previous season, 2008–09. Long range weather observations predict very hot, dry and windy weather conditions during the summer months, leading to a high risk of bushfire occurrence.In late September, several bushfires affected southeastern and northern Queensland. In October, bushfires affected much of the central latitudes of Australia, across Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. In early November, a heat wave across southeastern Australia and high bushfire risk weather, precipitated a series of bushfires in those states, particularly South Australia, where 6 people were injured in separate incidents. In December, a further 5 people were injured and a helicopter pilot killed, whilst fighting bushfires in NSW. Later that month, a 60-year-old man and three other men suffered burns whilst fighting fires in Southern NSW, while major fires burnt in the Riverina, far east Gippsland and Port Lincoln.Between Christmas and New Years 2009, bushfires affected the northern and central Wheatbelt of Western Australia, destroying 37 homes and about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres) of bushland. In early January 2010, Victoria and South Australia experienced "Catastrophic" category fire conditions, and on 10 January, a CFA volunteer was killed and 2 others injured after a fire truck rolled en route to a fire near Mansfield, in Victoria's north east.
The Black Saturday bushfires were a series of bushfires that ignited or were burning across the Australian state of Victoria on and around Saturday, 7 February 2009 and were Australia's all-time worst bushfire disasters. The fires occurred during extreme bushfire-weather conditions and resulted in Australia's highest ever loss of life from a bushfire; 173 people died and 414 were injured as a result of the fires.As many as 400 individual fires were recorded on 7 February. Following the events of 7 February 2009 and its aftermath, that day has become widely referred to as Black Saturday.
The 2009 Greek forest fires were a series of massive wildfires that broke out across several areas in Greece during the summer of 2009. The fires began in Grammatiko, about twenty-five miles north-east of the Greek capital, Athens on 21 August 2009 and spread quickly towards the suburbs, engulfing fourteen towns within the next three days. 10,000 residents of Agios Stefanos were asked to evacuate the area. Approximately 600 firefighters and soldiers, twelve fire-fighting aircraft and nine helicopters were deployed to extinguish the fire. These fires are the worst since 2007, though no casualties have been reported.
The 2009 Mediterranean wildfires were a series of wildfires that broke out across France, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkey in July 2009. Strong winds spread the fire during a hot, dry period of weather killing at least eight people, six of whom were in Spain. Some of the wildfires were caused by lightning, along with arson and military training.
The Mile 17 fire was a wildfire that began at about mile 17 of East End Road outside of Homer, Alaska on Tuesday, May 12, 2009 and lasted until Sunday, May 17.
The Minto Flats south fire was a large lightning-caused wildfire in Interior Alaska south of Fairbanks that ignited in late June 2009. It was by far the largest in what was termed the "Railbelt complex" of fires, so named because they were all near the main route of the Alaska Railroad. By July 16 it had burned more than 156,469 acres (63,321 ha). Alaska was experiencing an unusually hot and dry start to the summer season, which in turn led to a very active wildfire season. By the time the Minto Flats fire had become the largest fire in Alaska, over seventy other blazes were active throughout the state, stretching resources to their limits. The main body of the fire was deemed too large to actually try to extinguish, and firefighting efforts were focused from the beginning on protecting lives and property. In mid July it had grown to over 20,000 acres (8,100 ha), and was rapidly expanding along its souther edge; smokejumpers were deployed to protect cabins along the Teklanika River near Nenana. There is also an oil drilling rig in this area, and firefighters cleared the area surrounding it of fuel and instructed the drilling crew on the use of firefighting equipment. By the end of July, over 350 persons were involved in the firefighting effort, and continued hot, dry weather had helped the fire grow to over 300,000 acres (120,000 ha). The fire was not declared under control until late August.
The Shanta Creek Fire was a lightning caused wildfire that started on June 29, 2009 in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. More than 13,000 acres (53 km2; 20 sq mi) were burned and over 400 personnel were involved in the firefighting effort.
The Table Mountain fire was a large fire in and around the Table Mountain National Park in Cape Town, South Africa. It broke out at approximately 20:30 on 17 March 2009 in the vicinity of Rhodes Memorial and initial fears were that the fire would spread to UCT's Upper Campus. The Table Mountain National Park quickly deployed firefighting personals on the mountain, but the fire quickly spread due to the strong winds. At around 23:20 on Tuesday evening, the fire started moving up Devil's Peak and by 00:00 was at the tip and making its way around the mountain to the suburbs of Tamboerskloof, Oranjezicht, Vredehoek and Gardens on the north side. The flames were engulfing the mountain and the huge amounts of smoke made it hard for rescue and fire-fighting helicopters from making their way to the fire. By 00:30, people from the aforementioned areas were told to evacuate due to the strong winds pushing the fire quickly around the mountain. By this time, Fire & Rescue Services had deployed 29 fire engines and 90 firefighters all of whom were being assisted by 45 firefighters from the South African National Parks and volunteers of Disaster Management The day following the fire, four helicopters, including a defence force Atlas Oryx, were called in at dawn to water-bomb the fire, and to lift a team of firefighters high onto the mountain. Park fire chief Philip Prins said about 500 hectares of park land had been burned: some fynbos, some renosterveld, some grass, and stands of pine trees.
The Tumblebug Complex Fire burned 14,570 acres (5,900 ha) of Willamette National Forest land in Lane County, Oregon, United States, from September 12, 2009 to October 2009. The fire was located about 23 miles (37 km) southeast of Oakridge, Oregon, and roughly 5 miles (8.0 km) southwest of Crescent Lake.
On July 18, 2009, 3 wildfires broke out around the city of West Kelowna, British Columbia during extremely dry and windy conditions. Over 20,000 people were evacuated as a result of the fires. 9,877 hectares (24,410 acres) of forest was burned along with 4 buildings. All 3 fires were suspected as human caused but the exact ignition source is still unknown.
The 2010–11 Australian bushfire season was notable for a relative lack of bushfires along Eastern Australia due to a very strong La Niña effect, which instead contributed to severe flooding, in particular the 2010–2011 Queensland floods and the 2011 Victorian floods. As a result of these weather patterns, most major fire events took place in Western Australia and South Australia. Some later significant fire activity occurred in Gippsland in eastern Victoria, an area which largely missed the rainfall that lead to the flooding in other parts of the state.
The 2010 Bolivia forest fires led the country's government to declare a state of emergency, as wildfires spread across the country. More than 25,000 fires are burning across 15,000 square kilometres (3,700,000 acres). These raging fires have destroyed nearly sixty homes. Bolivia is unable to combat the fires properly as it does not have enough water bombing aircraft.There was a steep jump in fire hot-spots from 17,000 on Sunday August 15 to approximately 25,000 three days later. Some of the blazes were so strong that firefighters were unable to get close enough to contain them. The head of Bolivia's forestry service, Weimar Becerra, described the fires as "a total disaster, it is an environmental disaster. We have six forest fires which have a height of 50 m and are growing, and as a country we do not have the capacity to put them out".
The 2010 Dawu fire was a wildgrass fire incident that occurred in Dawu County, Sichuan, People's Republic of China on December 5, 2010. The fire incident killed 22 people including 15 soldiers and two government workers. More than 2,000 people fought to put out the fire. The fire lasted 17 hours and 30 minutes. The incident occurred at an extreme terrain. The situation was dangerous with strong fire, strong wind and smoke at the grassland. The fire rescue equipment could not be reached. Netizens even described this combination of difficult situation and circumstance as "Heaven's natural order in the right place" (天时地利).
The 2010 Guangxi wildfire occurred in western Guangxi, China during that year’s spring season.
The Machine Gun Fire or Camp Williams Fire was a wildfire in Herriman, Utah in 2010 that burned several dwellings. It was started by a mistake at a firing range by National Guard troops on a training exercise. 4,351 acres burned, approximately 1600 homes were evacuated, and 3 homes were destroyed.
The Mount Carmel forest fire (Hebrew: אסון הכרמל Ason HaKarmel, "The Carmel Disaster") was a deadly forest fire that started on Mount Carmel in northern Israel, just south of Haifa. The fire began at about 11:00 local time on 2 December 2010, and spread quickly, consuming much of the Mediterranean forest covering the region. The fire claimed 44 lives, making it the deadliest in Israeli history. The dead were mostly Israel Prison Service officer cadets, as well as three senior police officers, among them the chief of Haifa's police. More than 17,000 people were evacuated, including several villages in the vicinity of the fire, and there was considerable property and environmental damage.The fire appeared to be caused by human activity near the Druze town of Isfiya. On 6 December a 14-year-old resident of the town told police that he had inadvertently started the fire with a nargila coal. The teen's father argued that his son was witnessed in school at the time and could not have started the blaze.The fire was followed by a wave of arsons throughout Israel and the West Bank. These fires, which initially created confusion regarding the source of the Carmel blaze, were all extinguished within a few hours of being lit. The motivation for the attacks was not immediately clear. Israeli police have referred to some of these fires as arson.Government officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, called on other countries to help assist in firefighting efforts, and the Israel Defense Forces mobilized troops for the same purpose. The fire was defeated on 5 December after raging for four days.
The May 2010 Quebec wildfires were a series of wildfires that affected over 90,000 hectares (220,000 acres) from late May to June 2010. Over 120 fires broke out in one week, with most near La Tuque, 300 kilometers (190 mi) northeast of Montreal. Smoke from the wildfires caused smog warnings and resulted in heightened air quality indices throughout southern Quebec, including Montreal, Laval, and the Estrie, Montérégie, Lanaudière, Mauricie, and Centre-du-Québec regions; areas such as Ottawa and New England as far southeast as Eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island also reported poor air quality. The First Nations reserve of Wemotaci, where firefighters were forced to retreat due to the intensity of the fires and density of the resulting smoke, was evacuated, with more than 1,300 residents being temporarily relocated to the neighbouring city of La Tuque. Marcel Trudel, spokesman of Sopfeu—the organization responsible for containing the wildfires—reported that flames as high as 30 metres (98 ft) had been observed near the reserve. Three other communities—two of them also First Nations reserves—were evacuated as well. More than 1,200 firefighters worked to control the fires, including 200 from other provinces as well as from the U.S. states of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island.
The 2010 Russian wildfires were several hundred wildfires that broke out across Russia, primarily in the west in summer 2010. They started burning in late July and lasted until early September 2010. The fires were associated with record-high temperatures, which were attributed to climate change—the summer had been the hottest recorded in Russian history—and drought.Russian President Dmitry Medvedev declared a state of emergency in seven regions, and 28 other regions were under a state of emergency due to crop failures caused by the drought. The fires cost roughly $15 billion in damages.A combination of the smoke from the fires, producing heavy smog blanketing large urban regions and the record-breaking heat wave put stress on the Russian healthcare system. Munich Re estimated that in all, 56,000 people died from the effects of the smog and the heat wave. The 2010 wildfires were the worst on record to that time; in 2012, however, new wildfires broke out, and they proved even more extensive and damaging.
The Schultz Fire is a wildfire which burned over 15,000 acres (6,100 ha), including Schultz Peak in Coconino National Forest near Flagstaff, Arizona in June 2010. The suspected cause is a campfire left unattended, and the United States Forest Service is offering a $2500 reward for information.The Schultz Fire began at 11:09 A.M. June 20 north of Flagstaff and grew rapidly due to high winds, requiring the Coconino County sheriff to close U.S. 89 and evacuate 748 homes, an animal shelter, Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monument. 300 firefighters responded, including personnel from the U.S. Forest Service and a Type One Incident Management Team, sent to events of "national significance".
The Twitchell Canyon Fire was a wildfire that broke out in central Utah. The fire near central Utah’s Fishlake National Forest reportedly covered an area of approximately 13,383 hectares, or 33,071 acres. The fire was started by a lightning strike on July 20, 2010.
The 2011 Mexican fire season is the fire season which occurred between January and May 2011. Usually during May, the first wet-season rains begin to fall, followed by a soggy five months. As of May 20, 2011, the fire season had not slowed down and the flames continued to burn forests. Fires burned throughout the country, casting a smoky haze from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. 2011 turned out to be an extreme fire season in Mexico. By May 19, more than 530,000 hectares (1,300,000 acres or 2,000 square miles) of land had burned in the country since the beginning of the year, according to the Mexican government. In terms of area burned, 2011 surpassed every year since (and including) 1998, making it one of the most challenging fire seasons for 30 years.
The 2011–12 Australian bushfire season was mostly active between September 2011 to March 2012 and caused most damage in the state of Western Australia, particularly in the South West. The state had been prepared and had expected an increased risk of bushfire following heavy spring rains as a result of a La Nina weather pattern.
The Bastrop County Complex fire was the most destructive wildfire in Texas history, striking areas of Bastrop County in September and October 2011. Three separate fires started on September 4, 2011, as a result of strong winds caused by nearby Tropical Storm Lee, and merged into one large blaze that burned east of the city of Bastrop. Two people were killed by the fire, which destroyed 1,673 homes and inflicted an estimated $325 million of insured property damage. The fire furthermore caused severe damage to Bastrop State Park and the ancient Lost Pines Forest. After being largely contained in late September, the fire was declared controlled on October 10. The fire moved underground later in October and was finally extinguished on October 29.
The Honey Prairie Fire was a 2011 wildfire burning primarily scrub and brush in the Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia, clearing the land for fresh prairie grass. Because fire restores the prairie ecosystem, fire managers in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge allowed the fire to burn. Fire fighters worked to preserve structures and keep the fire within the refuge rather than contain the flames.Lightning started the fire on April 28, and by 6 p.m. on May 8, about 61,822 acres had burned. As of June 23, 2011, the fire had burned 268,335 acres. This makes it the biggest fire in the Okefenokee since 2007's Bugaboo scrub fire.As of September 16, 2011 the fire had burned a total of 309,079 acres and ultimately burned 309,200 acres before officially being declared out in April 2012
The Horseshoe 2 Fire was a 2011 wildfire located along the southeastern flank of the Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona. It began in Horseshoe Canyon on the Douglas Ranger District of the Coronado National Forest on May 8, 2011, at approximately 11:00 a.m. The fire was started by human activities, and burned over 9,000 acres (14 sq mi; 3,600 ha) in its first day. By June 1, 2011, the fire had burned an area of over 80,500 acres (125.8 sq mi; 32,600 ha) of grasses, shrubs, and trees along the mountain slopes. By June 8, it had grown to 106,661 acres (166.658 sq mi; 43,164 ha). By June 17, the fire was 65% contained and had become the fifth-largest wildfire in Arizona history. 100% containment was achieved on June 25 after a total area of 222,954 acres (348.366 sq mi; 90,226 ha) had burned.
The Las Conchas Fire was a wildfire in New Mexico, USA, in 2011. The fire started in Santa Fe National Forest and burned more than 150,000 acres, threatening Los Alamos National Laboratory and the town of Los Alamos. After five days of burning, it became the largest wildfire in New Mexico state history at the time, though it was surpassed the following year by the Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire.
The Pagami Creek Fire was a wildfire in Northern Minnesota, USA, that began with a lightning strike on August 18, 2011. After weeks of slow growth, the wildfire quickly spread to over 92,000 acres (370 km2) during several days of hot, dry, windy weather in mid-September. The fire spread beyond the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness to threaten homes and businesses. Smoke from the fires drifted east and south as far as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Ontario, Chicago, Poland, Ukraine, and Russia.
The Richardson fire (also known as the Richardson Backcountry fire) was a 2011 forest fire in the Canadian province of Alberta. It was located north of the city of Fort McMurray in an area known as the Richardson Backcountry. The fire started in mid-May 2011, and burned over 700,000 hectares (1,700,000 acres) of boreal forest. It threatened facilities in the Athabasca oil sands, and resulted in several evacuations and shutdowns. Firefighting efforts included agencies from several Canadian provinces as well as international crews. The Richardson fire was the largest fire in Alberta since the 1950 Chinchaga fire, and the second largest recorded fire in the province's history.
A large wildfire burned through the Town of Slave Lake, Alberta, Canada and its surrounding area from Saturday, May 14, 2011 through Monday, May 16, 2011. The conflagration, which originated 15 kilometres (9 mi) outside of town as a forest fire, was quickly pushed past fire barriers designed to protect the town by 100 kilometres per hour (60 mph) winds. The fire forced the complete evacuation of Slave Lake's 7,000 residents—considered the largest such displacement in the province's history at the time—to the nearby towns of Athabasca and Westlock, as well as the provincial capital of Edmonton. No casualties were reported amongst the town's population, but a pilot was killed when his helicopter crashed while he was battling the fires around the community.The fire destroyed roughly one-third of Slave Lake; 374 properties were destroyed and 52 damaged in the town, and another 59 were destroyed and 32 damaged in the surrounding Municipal District of Lesser Slave River No. 124, leaving 732 residents homeless. The town hall was completely gutted by the fire, as was the library and radio station. The hospital, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) station and schools remained standing, however. Insurable damage was estimated at C$750 million, making it the second costliest insured disaster in the country's history at the time. An RCMP investigation concluded that the cause of the fire was arson; however, no arrests were made.The disaster prompted an outpouring of support from across the province, and across Canada. The Canadian Red Cross and disaster relief agencies in Edmonton were inundated with donations—enough that they asked people to no longer make donations directly at the evacuation centres. ATB Financial offered to defer mortgage and loan payments for affected residents, while a Calgary-based rental company offered rental suites in Edmonton to displaced residents free of charge for three months. The provincial government promised $50 million in immediate aid to the town.
The 2011 Texas wildfires were a series of destructive wildfires in Texas, United States that occurred in the 2011 fire season. Statistics on the fires have been recorded since the current fire season began November 15, 2010. During 2011 in Texas, around 31,453 fires had burned 4,000,000 acres or 16,190 square kilometres (about double the previous record), 2,947 homes (1,939 of which were destroyed over the Labor Day weekend), and over 2,700 other structures. 47.3% of all acreage burned in the United States in 2011 was burned in Texas. The fires had been particularly severe due to the 2011 Southern US drought that covered the state, and was exacerbated by the unusual convergence of strong winds, unseasonably warm temperatures, and low humidity.Timber lost to drought and wildfire in 2011 could have produced $1.6 billion worth of products, resulting in a $3.4 billion economic impact in East Texas.Firefighters from more than forty-three states have been involved in the operation to combat the fires. Two firefighters were killed. Eastland volunteer firefighter Gregory M. Simmons, 51, died April 15 while battling a 3,000-acre (12 km2) blaze Friday afternoon near Eastland. Cactus volunteer firefighter Elias Jaquez died April 20 from injuries sustained while fighting a blaze April 9 in Moore County.On Sunday, September 4, 2011, a firestorm known as the Bastrop County Complex Fire engulfed Bastrop, Texas and by September 30 had destroyed 1,645 homes, burned 34,068 acres, and killed two people. This fire is now regarded as the most catastrophic wildfire in Texas history.Texas Governor Rick Perry declared a State of Disaster starting on December 21, 2010, and renewed the proclamation every month. On April 16, 2011, Perry asked that President Barack Obama declare 252 of 254 Texas counties as disaster areas due to wildfires and wildfire danger; the request was partially approved on July 1, 2011. Critics of the governor's relief efforts point to his budget cuts to the Texas Forest Service which provides a first line of defense against wildfires. Overall, wildfires in Texas during 2011 caused $510.927 million in damages and caused six fatalities, though an additional 62 people were injured.
The Wallow Fire, named for the Bear Wallow Wilderness area where the fire originated, was a wildfire in eastern Arizona and a small part of western New Mexico, United States, in the White Mountains near Alpine. It was started by an abandoned campfire. As of 26 June 2011, it had burned about 841 square miles (2,180 km2) in Apache, Greenlee, Graham, and Navajo counties in Arizona and Catron County in New Mexico, and is thus the biggest fire recorded in Arizona. Nearly 6,000 people were evacuated.
On July 22, 2012 two fires in Alt Empordà, Catalonia, Spain started in la Jonquera and in Portbou that affected the Girona Province for three days. The first started during midday; it has affected 13,800 hectares (included in this are some 3,000 hectares of crops that have not burned) 19 municipalities and caused two deaths. The fire of Portbou, moreover, began at 19:00 and was controlled in a few hours, burning 50 hectares and killing two people trying to flee the encroaching flames by jumping from the cliffs into the sea. In total, 3,200 residents were left without electricity and 1,700 without phone.
The 2012–13 Australian bushfire season had above average fire potential for most of the southern half of the continent from the east coast to the west. This is despite having extensive fire in parts of the country over the last 12 months. The reason for this prediction is the abundant grass growth spurred by two La Niña events over the last two years.Most parts of the country experienced a heat wave at the start of 2013, with a new national average maximum being set on 7 January 2013. The new record of 40.33 °C (105 °F) beat the old record of 40.17 °C (104 °F) that had been set on 21 December 1972. Another record also beaten in 2013 was Australia's mean temperature climbing from 31.86 °C (89 °F) set on 21 December 1972 to 32.23 °C (90 °F) on 7 January 2013.Additionally, six of the 20 hottest days in Australian records (by average maximum) have been in January 2013.Australia also experienced its hottest summer on average following a particularly hot spell in January. Using average day and night temperatures the average was found to be 28.6 °C (83 °F) beating the previous record set in the summer of 1997–1988. Fourteen of the weather bureau's 112 long term weather stations recorded their hottest days on record including one in Sydney that recorded a daytime record of 46 °C (115 °F). The daytime maximum temperatures for 2012–13 also beat the 1982–83 record and January was the hottest month since records began in 1910.
The Barry Point Fire was a wildfire that burned over 92,977 acres (376.26 km2) of Oregon and California forest land during the summer of 2012. The fire began on 5 August 2012, the result of a lightning strike. The fire consumed public forest and rangeland as well as private forest and grazing land located in Lake County, Oregon and Modoc County, California. The public lands effected by the fire are administered by the United States Forest Service and the Oregon Department of Forestry. The largest part of the private land was owned by the Collins Timber Company. At the peak of the firefighting effort, there were 1,423 personnel working on the fire. It took 22 days to fully contain the fire and then an additional three weeks to mop it up.
The 2012 Chios forest fire was a wildfire that broke out in the southern half of the Greek island of Chios shortly after 2 a.m. on Saturday 18 August 2012.Early on 18 August the people of two villages in southern Chios were evacuated as a safety measure, and the blaze threatened the army base near Vessas. By the evening of 20 August it was reported that a total of nine villages had been evacuated as the fire continued to advance.By Monday 20 August local authorities reported that 7000 hectares (16,000 acres) of forest and farmland had been destroyed. Official reports on 20 August added that many mastic trees in "Mastichochoria" region had been burned, the only world source of mastic resin, used in food, cosmetics and medicines. The beekeepers of Chios had lost 60 percent of their hives.About 360 firefighters, soldiers and volunteers were trying to control and extinguish the fires with the use of water-bombing planes and helicopters as well as 50 vehicles. The Greek government had asked for the help of aircraft from Spain and Italy to help not only with this but six other forest fires that broke out elsewhere in Greece on 19 August and five more on 20 August.Already on 18 August smoke from the fire was visible as far south as Crete, 350 kilometers (230 miles) away.
The 2012 Colorado wildfires were an unusually devastating series of Colorado wildfires, including several separate fires that occurred throughout June, July, and August 2012. At least 34,500 residents were evacuated in June.
The Duck Lake Fire occurred north of the Village of Newberry in Luce County, Michigan in the eastern half of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The fire started with a lightning strike on Wednesday, May 23, 2012 near Duck Lake. The Duck Lake Fire was reported 100% contained by the Michigan DNR on 15 June 2012 with 21,135 acres burned. The Duck Lake Fire was reported as the third worst fire in Michigan since 1881. It was the second major fire in Luce County within five years. On May 25, 2012, Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of disaster in Luce and Schoolcraft counties, which included a ban of fireworks and an outdoor burning ban in 49 counties, including all counties located in the Upper Peninsula and much of the northern half of the Lower Peninsula as a result of abnormally dry conditions. The fire caused the closure of Tahquamenon Falls State Park during the Memorial Day weekend.
The Flagstaff fire (also called Bison fire) was a forest fire located a few miles southwest of the city of Boulder, Colorado in Boulder County, Colorado. The fire was started by a lightning strike at 1:15 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time, on Tuesday, June 26, 2012, near the intersection of Flagstaff Road and Bison Drive, about three miles south of Flagstaff Mountain.As of 27 June 2012, the fire was not contained and had burned approximately 230 acres (0.36 sq mi; 0.93 km2). Evacuation had been ordered for 26 homes along Bison Drive in a small mountain subdivision. An evacuation center has been established at East Boulder Community Center in Boulder. The previous evacuation center, which was at New Vista High School in Boulder for the first few hours of the fire, has been shut down.A much larger neighborhood of southwest Boulder proper, consisting of everything south of Dartmouth Avenue (the southern boundary of the National Institute of Standards and Technology grounds) and west of Broadway, was given a pre-evacuation notification as of 5 p.m. on June 26, covering approximately 2400 households. This pre-evacuation order was lifted the following evening. However, Flagstaff Road remained closed except for firefighting vehicles.The Mesa Laboratory building of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in southwest Boulder, the nearest Boulder building to the fire, was evacuated about 3 p.m. on June 26 because of dense smoke. If the Mesa Lab had not already been evacuated, it would have been part of the pre-evacuation area.As of July 2, 2012, the Flagstaff fire was declared to be 90% contained and had burned 300 acres.
The High Park fire was a wildfire in the mountains west of Fort Collins in Larimer County, Colorado, USA. It was caused by a lightning strike and was first detected on the morning of June 9, 2012. It was declared 100 percent contained on June 30, 2012, and all associated evacuation orders were lifted.A 62-year-old woman was killed in the fire.The High Park fire burned over 87,284 acres (136.381 sq mi; 353.23 km2), becoming the second-largest fire in recorded Colorado history by area burned. It destroyed at least 259 homes, compared to the Black Forest Fire with a number of 511 houses, surpassing the number consumed by the 2010 Fourmile Canyon fire. The High Park fire became the third most destructive fire in Colorado history, in terms of the number of houses burned, but was surpassed about a week later by the Waldo Canyon fire.
Kirkland Lake is a town and municipality located in Timiskaming District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada. The 2011 population, according to Statistics Canada, was 8,493.The community name was based on a nearby lake which in turn was named after Winnifred Kirkland, a secretary of the Ontario Department of Mines in Toronto. The lake was named by surveyor Louis Rorke in 1907. Ms Kirkland never visited the town, and the lake that bore her name no longer exists because of mine tailings. The community comprises Kirkland Lake, as well as Swastika, Chaput Hughes and Harvey Kirkland.Kirkland Lake was built on gold, but it is equally well known for producing world-famous hockey players. Indeed, legendary hockey broadcaster Foster Hewitt called Kirkland Lake "the town that made the NHL famous", likely because in the early days of the NHL, it was not uncommon to find an NHLer from the town. The town celebrates this tradition at the Hockey Heritage North museum.Until January 1, 1972, the town was known as Township of Teck. A by-law was introduced, on July 20, 1971 to change the name of the municipality to Town of Kirkland Lake, effective January 1, 1972.
The Lava Fire was a wildfire that burned over 21,500 acres (87 km2) of Oregon rangeland during the summer of 2012. The fire began on 23 July 2012, the result of a lightning strike. The fire consumed rangeland vegetation and scrub forest located in and around lava beds in northern Lake County. The burned area was on public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management including a large area within a wilderness study area. Firefighters battled the blaze for over three weeks. At the peak of the firefighting effort, there were over 275 personnel working on the fire.
The Little Bear Fire was a wildfire in New Mexico that burned 44,330 acres and 254 buildings, making it the most destructive of human structures wildfire in the state's history. The previously most destructive fire was the Cerro Grande Fire. The fire began on June 4, 2012 from a lightning strike and quickly grew out of control due to dry windy conditions. The Little Bear Fire was 90 percent contained as of June 26, 2012.Ultimately there was no loss of human life as all but one couple in the evacuation zone said they received at least one call to evacuate the area. The New Mexico government was very proactive in notifying the general public about the fire and it mitigated damages.
The Long Draw Fire was a wildfire started by a lightning strike on July 8, 2012 at 6:04pm that burned 557,648 acres  in southeastern Oregon, in the Western United States. It is Oregon's largest wildfire since the 1865 Silverton Fire which burned over 1 million acres.
The 2012 Oklahoma wildfires were a series of wildfires which impacted areas throughout the state of Oklahoma. Starting earlier in the year, a widespread drought caused many areas to be exposed to wildfires.Starting in early August, the wildfires burned at least 52,000 acres, and destroyed at least 121 homes and businesses. A wildfire near Luther in Central Oklahoma destroyed about 50 homes and other buildings before getting under control on August 4. Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency on July 30 due to the drought and wildfires.Ongoing high winds have continued to affect Oklahoma. In Durant, high winds forced the Union Pacific Railroad to shut down one of their main railways through the town. In late November, Oklahoma State University researchers said that the wildfires and the ongoing drought were responsible for over $400 million in damages, harvest loss, and livestock loss.
The Utah Dump Fire was a wildfire that occurred in Utah in June 2012. The fire started on Thursday, June 22 near a landfill in the Lake Mountains area of Utah County when a fire sparked from target shooting.
The Waldo Canyon fire was a forest fire that started approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) southwest of Colorado Springs, Colorado on June 23, 2012 and was declared 100 percent contained on July 10, 2012 after no smoke plumes were visible on a small portion of the containment line on Blodgett Peak. The fire was active in the Pike National Forest and adjoining areas, covering a total of 18,247 acres (29 sq mi; 74 km2). The fire had caused the evacuation of over 32,000 residents of Colorado Springs, Manitou Springs and Woodland Park, several small mountain communities along the southwestern side of Highway 24, and partial evacuation of the United States Air Force Academy. There were 346 homes destroyed by the fire. U.S. Highway 24, a major east-west road, was closed in both directions. The Waldo Canyon Fire resulted in insurance claims totaling more than US $453.7 million. It was the most destructive fire in Colorado state history, as measured by the number of homes destroyed, until the Black Forest Fire surpassed it almost a year later when it consumed 486 homes and damaged 28 others.
The 2012 Washington wildfires were are series of 1,342 wildfires that burned 259,526 acres (1,050 km2) over the course of 2012. The fires primarily occurred in the Okanogan and Wenatchee National Forests during September and October 2012. A severe lightning storm on September 8 caused hundreds of fires across the east side of Cascade Range. Smoke caused hazardous air quality conditions in the cities of Ellensburg and Wenatchee, and was noticeable in Seattle. The cost of fighting the largest four fires was estimated to be $67.5 million.
The Whitewater-Baldy Complex Fire was a wildfire that started on May 9, 2012 in Catron County, New Mexico, USA.

The fire burned mostly within the Gila Wilderness, which includes the fire's namesake, Whitewater Baldy mountain.
The Beaver Creek Fire is a forest fire that began on August 7, 2013 after a lightning strike in an area twelve miles northeast of Fairfield, Idaho and northwest of Hailey, Idaho in Sawtooth National Forest. The fire burned through pine trees, sagebrush, timber in the understory, grass, and various riparian areas. The fire coated the resort areas of Hailey, Ketchum, and Sun Valley, in a layer of thick soot and ash. By the time the fire was fully contained on August 31, 114,900 acres of the Ketchum Ranger District of Sawtooth National Forest has been burned. Of the 114,900 acres burned, 57,000 acres were moderately damaged and 9,500 acres were severely damaged.
The 2013–14 Australian bushfire season is predicted to have above average fire potential for most states including portions of the north west of Western Australia, the north west of the Northern Territory and large areas of central Queensland following below average rainfall and above average temperatures in these areas in the months leading up to the fire season. The year 2013 was the hottest on record in Australia, with the average temperature from September 2012 to August 2013 being calculated to be 22.9 °C (73 °F) which is 1.1 °C (1.6 °F) higher than the 1961 to 1990 average.
The Big Meadows fire was a 2013 Colorado wildfire in Rocky Mountain National Park  that started on the same day as the Black Forest Fire and the Royal Gorge fire.
The Black Forest Fire was a forest fire that began near Highway 83 and Shoup Road in Black Forest, Colorado around 1:00 p.m. on June 11, 2013. As of June 20, 2013, the fire was 100 percent contained, 14,280 acres (22.31 sq mi; 57.8 km2) were burned, at least 509 homes were said to be destroyed, and two people had died. This was the most destructive fire in the state's history, surpassing the 2012 Waldo Canyon Fire which also began near Colorado Springs.The evacuation area covered 94,000 acres (147 sq mi; 380 km2) acres, 13,000 homes and 38,000 people. Three shelters were established in the area, including Elbert County Fairgrounds, which accepted humans, pets, and large animals. Two other shelters were designated for large animals only.On June 13, the Denver Post reported, 457 firefighters were working the fireline, including agencies around the fire, the Colorado Air National Guard, and select personnel from fire suppression teams on Fort Carson and the nearby United States Air Force Academy. Of note, 3 x UH-60 and 3 x CH-47 from 2-4 GSAB were instrumental in providing immediate response to assist in fighting the fires. The Battalion, commanded by LTC Tyler Smith, launched with very little notice to provide much needed support to the Front Range region. One of the CH-47D aircraft "Patches", was involved in the effort on every day. Governor John Hickenlooper addressed Emergency Managers at the command post on June 12. U.S. Northern Command assisted with fire fighting efforts.
The Carpenter 1 Fire was a large wildfire on Mount Charleston, 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The fire began on July 1, 2013 near Pahrump, Nevada, before spreading eastward. Carpenter 1 was seen for miles across the Las Vegas metropolitan area, and was the largest fire to occur on Mount Charleston in decades. After eight weeks of battling the fire, Carpenter 1 was fully contained on August 18, 2013. The fire consumed nearly 28,000 acres (11,000 ha), causing parts of Nevada State Route 156 and 157 to be closed, resulting in the evacuation of residents and closure of businesses and portions of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.  The fire, stretching between 5,000–11,000 feet (1,500–3,400 m) elevations, was fought by hundreds of firefighters and eight Hotshot crews, as well helicopters, fire engines, water tenders, and a DC-10 tanker plane. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the Carpenter 1 fire was considered "the highest ranked priority fire in the nation" at the time of its occurrence.
The 2013 Cherryville bushfire occurred on May 9–11 near the Adelaide Hills townships of Cherryville, Marble Hill and Basket Range, South Australia. More than 250 Country Fire Service volunteers and four aerial water bombers were deployed to fight the fire. One house was destroyed, and the area burnt exceeded 650 hectares (1,600 acres). It began at about 2:30p.m. on Thursday May 9 amid unseasonably warm weather when a private burn-off north of Cherryville became out of control and began to burn east into inaccessible country. Warm temperatures, high winds, and heavy fuel loads contributed to the spread of the fire. Firefighters were initially unable to fight the fire directly, due to the inaccessibility of the terrain. Firefighters eventually managed to contain the fire around 5p.m. on 11 May, assisted by a change in the weather which brought approximately 10mm of rain.The fire was notable in that it began over a week after the official fire-ban season ended. This prompted calls for the season to be extended into May; the Government announced on May 12 that a review of the policy would be conducted. However, concerns were raised that this would limit the ability of residents and the CFS to conduct fuel-reduction burns.
In the summer of 2013, there were several major wildfires in Colorado in the United States. During June and July, record high temperatures and dry conditions fueled the fires all across the state. By July 24, 570 structures had been destroyed and 2 lives were lost. Below is a list of the major fires of the year.
The East Peak Fire is a forest fire that began east of the East Spanish Peak near La Veta, Colorado at 5:10 PM on Wednesday, June 19, 2013. The fire was originally named the Scout Ranch Fire because the fire was first reported by the Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch.
The 2013 New South Wales bushfires were a series of bushfires in Australia across the state of New South Wales primarily starting, or becoming notable, on 13 October 2013; followed by the worst of the fires beginning in the Greater Blue Mountains Area on 16 and 17 October 2013.High fuel loads, coupled with warm, dry and windy weather, provided dangerous conditions which fuelled the fires. At the peak of the fires, on the morning of 18 October, over 100 fires were burning across the state. The Premier of New South Wales Barry O'Farrell declared a state of emergency on 20 October, empowering firefighters to evict residents and demolish fire-affected buildings.The fires are the worst in New South Wales since the 1960s. As of 19 October 2013, 248 houses and other structures were destroyed across the state. Two fatalities were attributed to the fires. It was estimated that claims will exceed A$94 million.
The Royal Gorge fire was a forest fire that began south of the Royal Gorge Bridge near Canon City, Colorado at around 1:15 PM on June 11, 2013.Although the fire jumped the Royal Gorge, the famous Royal Gorge Bridge is still standing, only losing 32 wooden planks off of the platform. However, according to Peggy Gair, a spokeswoman for the park, "many buildings on the property were a catastrophic loss," including the aerial tram over the Royal Gorge.
The 2013 Tasmanian bushfires were a series of bushfires in south-eastern Tasmania in starting in November/December 2012, with major fires in early January 2013, right through until late April 2013.It was predicted early on that the 2012-13 had the potential to be worse than usual. High fuel loads, coupled with a dry, warm and windy, providing potentially dangerous conditions. The Tasmania Fire Service implemented a new media campaign, with a view to increasing community preparedness and awareness of what to do if bushfires threatened. But nobody predicted that the fire season would last for almost 6 months, which is unprecedented in the recorded history of Tasmania.
The West Fork Complex was a complex of wildfires near Wolf Creek Pass in southern Colorado. The first fire, the West Fork fire, was started by lightning at about 1 PM on June 5, 2013. All three fires were started by lightning. As the fire moved into heavy dead timber in early June thousands of firefighters struggled to prevent movement of the fires into populated areas.It was composed of the West Fork fire, northeast of Pagosa Springs, Colorado, south of Wagon Wheel Gap, and southwest of South Fork, Colorado; the Papoose fire south of Creede, Colorado; and the small Windy Pass fire, near the Wolf Creek ski area. As of the afternoon of July 8:Papoose: 49,056 acres (76.650 sq mi; 198.52 km2)West Fork Fire: 58,576 acres (91.525 sq mi; 237.05 km2)Windy Pass: 1,417 acres (2.214 sq mi; 5.73 km2)Much of the complex was in the Weminuche Wilderness but has burned into surrounding areas in the San Juan and Rio Grande National Forests and private land. The fires, particularly the West Fork fire, burned in dead trees killed by the spruce beetle. Due to the intensity of the West Fork fire which for some days was burning in windy conditions no attempt was made to directly attack it. Aggressive, and so far successful, efforts were made to prevent the Windy Pass fire from reaching the ski area. South Fork and Wagon Wheel Gap were evacuated and U.S. Highway 160 and State Highway 149 were closed to the west of South Fork. Route 160 was reopened at 6 AM June 29; Route 149 was reopened June 30. Most personnel were engaged in structure protection efforts to the west of South Fork, on the low terrain near the Rio Grande River to the north of the fires, and at tourist facilities south of Creede. On the 19th of July when the last incident update was made the fires had a total area of 109,615 acres and were 66% contained with 43 personnel engaged in combating them; the fire was described as "smoldering." There are two incident command posts, one in Pagosa Springs, Colorado for the portion of the fire on the west side of the Continental Divide, the other in Del Norte, Colorado for the portion on the east side. As of July 8 the portion of the West Fork fire west of the Continental Divide remained at 0% containment while the portion east of the Continental Divide was 25%.There was about .20 of an inch of precipitation on some parts of the fire June 30 due to a thunderstorm, but strong and erratic winds also stimulated the fire. On July 4, 2013 the fires were described as "creeping and smoldering" with fire suppression efforts being directed at preventing the expansion of the fire into heavy stands of dead and down fuel. Growth of the fire had continued on the southeastern side of the Papoose fire but as of July 8 widespread showers had moderated fire behavior. As of July 14 humidity was gradually increasing as the monsoon season approached with occasional thunderstorms expected and flash flood warnings issued for the area. As of July 19 precipitation had considerably dampened the fire, but smoldering and smoke continued.
The Yarnell Hill Fire was a wildfire near Yarnell, Arizona, ignited by lightning on June 28, 2013. On June 30, it overran and killed 19 City of Prescott firefighters, members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots. The wildfire was fully contained by July 10, 2013.This event resulted in the highest wildland firefighter death toll in the United States since the 1933 Griffith Park Fire killed 29 firefighters, and the highest death toll from any U.S. wildfire since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire killed 25 people. It is the sixth-deadliest American firefighter disaster overall and the deadliest wildfire ever in Arizona.
The 2014 forest fire season in the Northwest Territories of Canada is reputed to be the worst for at least two decades. As of 3 July, there had been 123 fires reported in the territory, of which at least 92 were still active and 13 were thought to be human-caused. By 9 July the total had reached 164 fires and on 10 July over 130 fires were thought to be burning. The smoke generated by the fires was blown in the Prairie Provinces and created a moderate health risk there leading Environment Canada to declare an air quality advisory for southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba on 9. July The smoke reached as far away as Bismark, North Dakota, over 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) away. By 8 July the largest fires were the Lutsel K'e fire at 31,000 hectares (77,000 acres) and the Gamèti-Wekweeti fire at 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres). By 9 July an area of 5,000 square kilometres (1,900 sq mi) had been consumed, about the size of the island of Trinidad.
The 2014 Västmanland wildfire (Swedish: Skogsbranden i Västmanland 2014) was a wildfire that broke out on the afternoon of 31 July 2014 on the border between Sala Municipality and Surahammar Municipality in Västmanland, Sweden. It is Sweden's largest wildfire in 40 years. After an EU appeal, Italy and France provided firefighting aircraft.On 4 August 2014 the evacuation of residents began in Gammelby alongside Route 668 east of Lake Virsbo, Västervåla and Ängelsberg. As of 5 August 2014, over one thousand people were forced to evacuate their homes, and the town of Norberg, with about 4500 residents, was being considered for evacuation.

It encompassed over 15,000 hectares and was located northwest of Sala. The Swedish Armed Forces were mobilized, with about 100 personnel providing support to the firefighters as of 7 August.It was reported that nine volunteers were surrounded by fire and had to be rescued by professional firefighters on 5 August. Because of this, volunteer firefighting help from the public was no longer accepted. Firefighters found a 42-year-old man in the forest who was badly burned but still alive. The police reported that he was taken directly to a hospital for treatment.The wildfire threatened the UNESCO World Heritage Site Engelsberg Ironworks. The owners of the Ironworks, Nordstjernan, rented two helicopters of their own to water the area close to the site.The Swedish police started a preliminary investigation of the cause of the fire, to see if it was caused by criminal negligence. According to local media, a driver of a ground-preparation vehicle stated that the fire started in his vehicle and that no fire watch was posted despite a very high risk of fire.
The 2014–15 Australian bushfire season was expected to have the potential for many fires in eastern Australia after lower than expected rainfall being received in many area. Bushfire authorities released warnings in the early spring that the season could be particularly bad.Warmer and drier weather conditions were experienced during winter and extended into 2015, due to a developing El Niño event. Sydney was on track to record its hottest autumn on record and only had one fifth of the average rainfall in May. Adelaide recorded sixteen consecutive days of 20 °C (68 °F) in May 2014.Queensland sweltered through a heatwave with record October temperatures being set in many towns through the state. New October records included Toowoomba with 36.4 °C (98 °F), St George with 42.6 °C (109 °F), Amberley with 41.3 °C (106 °F) and Roma with 41.6 °C (107 °F).

The 2015 Canadian wildfires were a series of wildfires across Canada and Alaska in July 2015 which spread smoke across most of North America. Over two hundred fires were ablaze across British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.Tens of thousand of people had been evacuated and more than 1,900,000 hectares (4,700,000 acres) of forest had burned. Fire-fighters from Mexico, Western Australia, and New Zealand were sent to assist. The Canadian military also fought the fires. Since the smoke was so dense, warnings had been given across central and Western Canada; additionally, parts of the western United States were also issued air advisories because of the amount of smoke. Wildfires have burned one million hectares (2.4 million acres) in Saskatchewan in the past year according to statistics posted on the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. The words people have used to describe this natural disaster is "extreme, unprecedented, and historic. A majority of the ecosystem where the fire had been burning consists of boreal forests. Circumstances for catastrophic fires were created as a result of the fuel buildup starting in the 1950s caused fire inhibition. This outcome created a change in the landscape-age mosaic. Initially, this fuel buildup was created for closed canopy ecosystems such as the Pinus ponderosa located in the western United States.
The 2015 Esperance bushfires were a series of catastrophic bushfires that burned from 15 to 26 November and affected the Goldfields-Esperance region in the Australian state of Western Australia.

As of 2016, the Cascades fire was the worst bushfire in Western Australia in terms of human fatalities.The Cascades fire destroyed Scaddan town hall, one house, 16 non-residential structures and dozens of vehicles in the communities of Grass Patch, Salmon Gums and Scaddan. There was also significant damage to rural produce; approximately 4,500 head of livestock died and 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) of crop—constituting about 500,000 tonnes of grain—were burnt. In addition, the Merivale fire destroyed 2 houses in Stockyard Creek, and the Cape Arid complex destroyed significant areas of Western Ground Parrot habitat—reportedly up to 90%—prompting discussion that the critically endangered parrot could "... become the first bird in at least 200 years to become extinct in Western Australia".
From 12 to 16 April 2015, a series of wildfires spread across southern Siberia, Russia. In the Republic of Khakassia, 29 people were killed and 6,000 left homeless. Further east in Zabaykalsky Krai, four people died in wildfires near Chita. Damage was also reported in Inner Mongolia.

The 2015–16 Australian bushfire season was the most destructive bushfire season in terms of property loss since the 2008–09 Australian bushfire season, with the loss of 400–410 houses and at least 500 non-residential buildings as a result of wild fires between 1 June 2015 and 31 May 2016. With 8 deaths as a direct result of fire, and the death of a volunteer firefighter due to unrelated health complications while on duty, the season was also saw the most human fatalities since the 2008–09 Australian bushfire season; 6 died in Western Australia, 2 in South Australia and 1 in New South Wales.The season witnessed four notable fires; the Cascades fire in Western Australia, the Pinery fire in South Australia, the Great Ocean Road fire in Victoria, and the Harvey-Waroona fire in Western Australia.
The Okanogan Complex Fire was a wildfire affecting Okanogan County in north-central Washington state. It was composed of five fires that were caused by lightning strikes on August 15, 2015, with two of the fires near Conconully merging days later on August 19. At its peak, it burned over 304,782 acres (123,341 ha) of land and forced the evacuations of numerous towns, including Conconully, Twisp and Winthrop. Over 1,250 firefighters were deployed to the Okanogan Complex. Three United States Forest Service firefighters were killed in an accident near Twisp on August 19. Traditional methods of containing such wildfires, such as creating bulldozer lines, are not readily available due to the irregular terrain and because an inversion layer trapped smoke in the valley, making it difficult to fly in water by helicopter.On August 24, some media outlets reported that it had become the largest wildfire in Washington state history, surpassing the Carlton Complex fire of 2014. The Okanogan Complex fire has not merged into a single fire, and so the Carlton Complex remains the state's largest single fire.By August 25 more help was arriving and no more structures had burned. However, nearly all the fires had continued "to grow with little containment gained" and higher winds were predicted by the end of the week that would feed the flames. On August 25, 2015 there were 1,345 firefighters and 15 percent of the fire had been contained.By September 19, the fire was 95% contained and management was turned over to local firefighters.

In 2016, forest fires have been noted in numerous places across the Indian state of Uttarakhand. These fires, set mainly in pine forests in the slopes of the sub-Himalayan region, produced clouds of smoke. Widespread comments in the Indian news media led to the government taking action, deploying the National Disaster Response Force and making use of Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopters fitted with "Bambi buckets" to douse the fires with water. The forest department estimated that 3,500 hectares (8,600 acres) of forest had been burnt. Nearly 1,600 incidences of fires were detected which were brought under control by 2 May. The rains on 3 May helped in reducing the impact of fires.

The 2007 California Wildfire Season saw over 9,000 separate wildfires that charred 1,087,110 acres (4,399.4 km2) of land. 30 of those wildfires were part of the Fall 2007 California firestorm, which burned approximately 970,977 acres (about 3,900 km², or 1,500 mi²) of land from Santa Barbara County to the U.S.–Mexico border, surpassing the October 2003 California wildfires in scope, which were estimated to have burned . At the peak of the wildfire activity in October 2007, the raging wildfires were visible from space.The wildfires killed a total of 14 people, with nine of them dying directly from the fires; 160 others were injured, including at least 124 firefighters.California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in seven California counties where fires were burning. President George W. Bush concurred, and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. Over 6,000 firefighters worked to fight the blazes; they were aided by units of the United States Armed Forces, United States National Guard, almost 3,000 prisoners convicted of non-violent crimes, and 60 firefighters from the Mexican cities of Tijuana and Tecate. The fires forced approximately 1,000,000 people to evacuate from their homes, becoming the largest evacuation in California's history.Major contributing factors to the extreme fire conditions were drought in Southern California, hot weather, and the strong Santa Ana winds with gusts reaching 85 mph (140 km/h). California's "fire season," which traditionally runs from June to October, has become a year-round threat due to a mixture of perennial drought and the increasing number of homes built in canyons and on hillsides surrounded by brush and forest.The fires had numerous sources. Several were triggered by power lines damaged by the high winds.  One fire started when a semi-truck overturned. Another was suspected as having been deliberately caused; the suspect was shot and killed in flight by state authorities. A 10-year-old boy admitted that he accidentally started the Buckweed Fire by playing with matches. Causes of the remaining fires remain under investigation. The last fires, the Santiago and Poomacha Fires, were fully contained on November 9, 2007, about 19 days after the series of wildfires had begun to ignite.During the season, the National Interagency Fire Center reports that two firefighters were killed. One died via helicopter and the second in a bulldozer rollover.
The Angora Fire was a wind driven fire that started near North Upper Truckee Road subdivision near Angora Lakes, Fallen Leaf Lake, Echo Lake and South Lake Tahoe, California around 2:15 PM on Sunday, June 24, 2007 as a result of an illegal campfire. As of July 2, 2007, the fire was 100% contained, and 100% control (all interior fires extinguished) was achieved on July 10. The fire burned 3,100 acres (12.5 km2), destroyed 242 residences and 67 commercial structures, and damaged 35 other homes.

The Corral Fire was a wildfire that burned from November 24 until November 27, 2007 in the Malibu Creek State Park., 2007. The fire, which burned 4,901 acres (20 km2) of land, forced the evacuation of 10,000-14,000 residents in Los Angeles, and injured 7 firefighters.The recurrence of powerful Santa Ana Winds fueled the fire upon its start on November 24 at 3:24 AM PST. The Corral Fire rapidly expanded, and soon destroyed over 80 structures, including 49 homes, with another 27 damaged. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger reactivated the state of emergency on November 24, which was declared during previous months wildfires to "...(provide) any needed resources to fight these fires or help those Californians who have been impacted." During the morning of November 27, at 8:00 AM PST, the Corral Fire was reported to be 100% contained.
The Harris Fire burned in a northwest direction from its starting point at Harris Ranch Road in the town of Potrero, in the far south of San Diego County, a few miles north of Tecate, Mexico. On October 23 the fire approached eastern Chula Vista.Many communities were evacuated, with evacuation centers set up at a nearby high school and community center.Thomas James Varshock, 52, of Potrero, died on his property during the Harris Fire on Sunday. His teenage son suffered burn injuries, as did four firefighters of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection who attempted to rescue them. The fire may also have caused the deaths of four migrant workers near the U.S.–Mexico border. An estimated 1,210 firefighters battled this fire.The Harris Fire also affected northern Mexico, near the town of Tecate.

The fire, which started on Labor Day, September 3, 2007 scorched 64,997 acres (263 km2) before being contained on September 19. Approximately 2,300 firefighters were involved in fighting the fire. Strong winds pushed smoke to the Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, Nevada and Idaho. In Plumas County, 500 homes were threatened by the Moonlight Fire; 100 residences were evacuated near Greenville in the North Arm area of Indian Valley, as the wild fire was still raging in the Plumas National Forest.
The Rice Fire was a wildfire that burned from 22 October 2007 until 5 November 2007 in Fallbrook, California. While not one of the largest fires of the 2007 California wildfire season, only burning 9,472 acres (38 km2), it was one of the most destructive with 248 structures being destroyed.As the fire grew, it caused major evacuations and the closure of Interstate 15.
The Santiago Fire was a wildfire located near Santiago Canyon in Orange County, California, U.S., and one of twenty-three California wildfires of October 2007. The fire was intentionally started.
The Witch Fire (also known as the Witch Creek Fire) was the second largest of the 2007 California wildfire season. Hundreds of thousands of residents were informed of evacuations through the Reverse 911 system. This evacuation came almost four years to the day after the Cedar Fire of 2003.The fire started in Witch Creek Canyon near Santa Ysabel and quickly spread to San Diego Country Estates, Ramona, Rancho Bernardo, Poway and Escondido. Locals in the San Pasqual Valley area reported wind gusts of over 100 mph (160 km/h). From there the fire jumped over Interstate 15 and continued west, causing significant damage in Lake Hodges, Del Dios and Rancho Santa Fe.Strong Santa Ana winds pushed the fires west towards the coast. San Diego County Sheriff William B. Kolendar stated that the Witch Creek Fire could be "well in excess of the Cedar Fire of 2003". While many coastal communities were evacuated as the fire moved west, the shifting winds prevented it from directly threatening those areas.Residents located between the Del Dios Highway and State Route 56 were ordered to evacuate. By 9:30 p.m. on October 22, a dispatch from the city of Del Mar's web site stated "For your safety, we are strongly advising that all Del Mar residents evacuate." Evacuations were also ordered for Scripps Ranch neighborhood, specifically "Everything south of Scripps Poway Parkway, north of MCAS Miramar, east of Interstate 15, and west of Highway 67". The Mesa Grande Indian Reservation was evacuated due to the Witch Fire. Residents of the Barona Indian Reservation were advised to leave, though the evacuation was not mandatory. The casino on the reservation was closed. At approximately 01:00 on 23 October, fire broke out near Wildcat Canyon to the south of Barona, where many houses were destroyed and lives lost in the Cedar Fire. Residents of Wildcat Canyon and Muth Valley were ordered to evacuate, and the road was closed. The evacuations of Del Mar, Chula Vista, Poway, Del Mar Heights and Scripps Ranch were lifted for many residents on Tuesday October 23 in the late afternoon. At 9:50 p.m. PDT October 23, 2007, the town of Julian, California was ordered to evacuate. Due to the fires, there was no power or phone service in the town.Evacuation sites included Qualcomm Stadium, Escondido High School, Mission Hills High School, Poway High School, Mira Mesa Senior High School, and the Del Mar Fairgrounds.Many major roads were also closed as a result of fires and smoke. On October 22, the California Highway Patrol closed Interstate 15 in both directions between State Routes 78 and 56. On October 24, 2007 the Horno Fire forced the closure of Interstate 5 as well as the Amtrak Surfliner service between Oceanside and San Clemente. Traffic from Interstate 5 was being diverted to Interstate 15, which had reopened. 1,841 firefighters were assigned to the fire.In addition to the costs of fighting the fire, the Witch Fire is estimated to have cost more than $1 billion in insured damages.
The Zaca Fire was a wildfire which began burning in the San Rafael Mountains, northeast of the Santa Ynez Valley in Santa Barbara County, California.The fire started on July 4, 2007, and by August 31, it had burned over 240,207 acres (972.083 km2), making it California's second largest fire in recorded history at that time after the Cedar Fire of 2003. As of 2015, it is currently California's fourth largest fire in recorded history. The fire was contained on September 2, 2007. It was declared controlled on October 29, 2007.The fire was started as a result of sparks from a grinding machine on private property which was being used to repair a water pipe.By August 12, progress was being made on the fire through the combined efforts of firefighters and aircraft. Firefighters were able to turn the direction of the fire away from the Paradise Road community.
The 2008 California Wildfire Season was one of the most devastating since the turn of the 21st century. While only 4,108 fires occurred, less than half as many as in 2009, the total area burned far exceeded that of previous years. Throughout the year 1,375,781 acres (5,567.59 km2) of land was burned.By July 5, 2008, 328 wildfires were burning, and those fires were only 81% contained. For the first time since 1977, the military helped with ground-based firefighting, when Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger dispatched 400 California National Guard troops, including Chief Medical Officer Susan Pangelinan, to manage fire lines. He said the number of fires had stretched the state's fire-fighting resources thin. "One never has resources for 1,700 fires. Who has the resources for that?" Schwarzenegger said, adding "Something is happening, clearly. There's more need for resources than ever before... it's fire season all year round".
The Basin Complex Fire near Big Sur started on June 21 as a result of a lightning strike and burned 162,818 acres (658.90 km2), eventually torching the Ventana Wilderness. More than $120 million was spent to fight the fire, making it is the most expensive fire in California history, and the second most expensive in U.S. history, exceeded only by the Biscuit Fire in 2002.The fire forced the evacuation of Big Sur prior to the July 4 holiday weekend. Camp Pico Blanco was forced to evacuate the camp and diverted its Scouts to Boulder Creek Scout Reservation in Santa Cruz. The camp lost only one building, an outlying ranger's cabin. Big Sur residents were permitted to return on July 9. While further north, the town of Paradise in Butte County was evacuated when flames burned close.As of 2014 the fire is the 10th largest wildfire in California since accurate records began being kept in 1932.
The Freeway Complex Fire also known as the Triangle Complex Fire or Corona Fire was a 2008 wildfire in the Santa Ana Canyon area of Orange County in the US state of California.

The Gap Fire was a fire that burned 9,443 acres (38.21 km2) of the Santa Ynez Mountains above Goleta, California between July 1 and July 28, 2008. The fire burned primarily on steep slopes above the community of Goleta. Dense brush that had not burned in over fifty-years coupled with steep difficult terrain made the fire challenging for firefighters.Initial efforts by the Santa Barbara County Fire Department nearly contained the fire before it broke loose. When the first engine arrive on scene at 5:32 p.m. on July 1, the fire was less than a quarter acre, but then winds came up and swept the fire over the ridge and down into drainage. By July 3 the fire had grown to more than 2,000 acres (810 ha) forcing the county to declare a state of emergency. During the initial operational periods, the fire was driven downhill by Sundowner winds and burned to the edges of Goleta requiring the multiple strike teams for structure protection. After the initial 48 hours, the winds died down allowing firefighters to begin working in the mountainous terrain to contain the fire.
The Indians Fire was a wildfire in the Ventana Wilderness of the Los Padres National Forest in the Santa Lucia Range which that started on June 8, 2008 and burned uncontained until July 10 scorching 81,378 acres (329.33 km2) of land. This fire burned predominately within the Los Padres National Forest, Monterey Ranger District, inside the Ventana Wilderness. Other affected properties include portions of Fort Hunter Liggett military base and private property. The suppression cost exceeded $40.7 million, not including resource damages and rehabilitation costs.On June 10, 2008, a residential structure on the Chase Ranch burned down. The ranch had restricted access; therefore, the damage was not documented by the Forest Service. A Forest Service Fire Prevention Technician risked her life to evacuate the reluctant cabin owner, just before the fire burned over the cabin.On June 11, 2008, during a burnout operation, aggressive fire behavior produced a fire plume which burned over Forest Service firefighters along the Del Venturi Road. An entrapment occurred when a rotating vertical plume developed and the crew became overcome by the fire. Three firefighters sustained major burns and were evacuated from the fire.
The Sayre Fire, also known as the Sylmar Fire, was a November 2008 wildfire that resulted in the loss of 489 residences in Los Angeles, California, United States, the "worst loss of homes due to fire" in the city's history.

The Sesnon Fire (also known as the Porter Ranch Fire) was a wildfire that broke out near the oil fields of Oat Mountain, north of Porter Ranch, California, on Monday October 13, 2008. The cause of this fire was a power line falling onto dry brush near a drainage area. A state of emergency was declared by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on October 13 in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties The fire burned more than 22 square miles (57 km2) and cost US$7.9 million to fight. This fire occurred with two others, one in San Diego County and another at the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley.

The Tea Fire ignited in the Cold Springs section of Montecito at approximately 17:50 PST on November 13, 2008. The fire started at a Mar Y Cel historic structure called the "Tea House" above Mountain Drive, giving the fire its name. Spreading rapidly, it was fanned by offshore winds, known as Sundowners that blow down the Santa Ynez Mountains, gusting up to 85 mph (113 km/h). These winds caused the fire to spread into the city of Santa Barbara. The fire was 40% contained on the 15th, 75% on the 16th, and by November 17, 2008 it was 95% contained after burning 1,940 acres (7.9 km2), and on November 18, it was 100% contained.On November 15, 2008, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger visited areas burned in the Tea Fire, noting: "When you walk around the area that was destroyed, it looks like hell."
The 2009 California wildfires were a series of 8,291 wildfires that were active in the state of California, USA, during the year 2009. The fires burned more than 404,601 acres (632 sq mi; 1,637 km2) of land from early February through late November, due to Red Flag conditions, destroying hundreds of structures, injuring 134 people, and killing two. The wildfires also caused at least $134.48 million (2009 USD) in damage. Although the fires burned many different regions of California in August, the month was especially notable for several very large fires which burned in Southern California, despite being outside of the normal fire season for that region.The Station Fire, north of Los Angeles, was the largest and deadliest of these wildfires. It began in late August, and resulted in the devastation of 160,577 acres (251 sq mi; 650 km2) of land as well as the death of two firefighters. Another large fire was the La Brea Fire, which burned nearly 90,000 acres (141 sq mi; 364 km2) in Santa Barbara County earlier in the month. A state of emergency was also declared for the 7,800 acres (12 sq mi; 32 km2) Lockheed Fire in Santa Cruz County to the north.
The Guiberson Fire was a wildfire that burned from September 22 until September 27, 2009 in the Guiberson Canyon between Fillmore and Moorpark. The fire destroyed an estimated 17,500 acres (71 km2), destroying an outbuilding and injuring 10 firefighters. On day two of the fire Governor Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency. The fire, which started between Fillmore and Moorpark, caused the evacuation of almost 600 homes in Meridian Hills and Bardsdale with about 1,000 structures threatened, in addition to oil pipelines in the area. The cause of the fire is still unknown.
The Jesusita Fire was a wildfire that began at approximately 1:45 PM on May 5, 2009 in the hills of Santa Barbara, California. The fire burned 8,733 acres (35.34 km2), destroyed 80 homes and damaged 15 more before being 100% contained.On May 8, 2009, the fire perimeter extended from west of Highway 154, in the hills burned in the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, across the front country of the Santa Ynez Mountains east through Mission Canyon, Rattlesnake Canyon, and into the hills above Montecito, reaching the area burned by the Goleta Gap Fire in July 2008 and the Montecito Tea Fire in November 2008. Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.
The La Brea Fire was a 2009 wildfire which occurred in Southern California in the United States. The fire began near La Brea Creek in Santa Barbara County, in the Los Padres National Forest. The fire burned 89,489 acres (140 sq mi; 362 km2) of chaparral between August 8 and August 22, 2009, but only destroyed two structures—a cabin and an unused ranger station. The huge Zaca Fire burned in the same region in 2007, and some of the same fire lines were used to contain the La Brea Fire. A propane stove at an illegal marijuana plantation inside the National Forest is believed to have ignited the fire. The plantation held approximately 30,000 marijuana plants, worth an estimated US$90 million. Prior to the blaze, seventeen other plantations hidden in the forest had been discovered by authorities, who destroyed more than 225,000 plants worth over US$675 million. No suspects were captured at the site, but investigators did find an AK-47 assault rifle, and warned the public that the suspects could be armed and dangerous.
The Lockheed Fire was a wildfire in the Santa Cruz Mountains in the Swanton and Bonny Doon areas of Santa Cruz County, California. The fire was started on August 12, 2009 at 7:16 PM PDT.A Red Cross shelter was established at Vintage Faith Church in Santa Cruz for families who were evacuated from the area. An animal evacuation center was also established at the Santa Cruz County Fairgrounds.Many resources were demanded for this fire. The steep terrain and lack of road access in the area made it difficult to fight the blaze.The cause of the fire was determined to be an out of control or unattended camp fire.
The Station Fire started in the Angeles National Forest near the U.S. Forest Service ranger station on the Angeles Crest Highway on August 26 2009. Two firefighters, Captain Tedmund Hall and Firefighter Specialist Arnie Quinones, were killed on August 30 when their fire truck plunged off a cliff as they tried to set backfires to slow the blaze. The blaze threatened 12,000 structures in the National Forest and the nearby communities of La Cañada Flintridge, Glendale, Acton, La Crescenta, Littlerock and Altadena, as well as the Sunland and Tujunga neighborhoods of the City of Los Angeles. Many of these areas faced mandatory evacuations as the flames drew near, but as of September 6, all evacuation orders were lifted. The Station Fire burned on the slopes of Mount Wilson, threatening numerous television, radio and cellular telephone antennas on the summit, as well as the Mount Wilson Observatory, which includes several historically significant telescopes and multimillion-dollar astronomical facilities operated by UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley and Georgia State University. A 40-mile (64-kilometer) stretch of the Angeles Crest Highway was closed until 2010 due to guardrail and sign damage, although the pavement remained largely intact.
The 2010 California wildfires were a series of wildfires that were active in the state of California during the year 2010.
The Bull Fire was a wildfire that scorched 16,442 acres (6,654 ha) of land in Kern County, California. The fire, which started on July 26, was the largest wildfire of the 2010 California wildfire season as well as one of the most destructive with 16 structures being destroyed. As the fire progressed it burned in mainly grass and brush on both sides of the Kern River. By July 29 the fire had burned nearly 16,000 acres (6,500 ha) and was 12% contained.As the fire approached the cities of Riverkern and Kernville it forced the evacuations of hundreds of residents as well as Camp Erwin Owen, a juvenile detention camp.It became evident early on that the fire had been caused by humans and investigators sealed off the origin of the fire as a crime scene.
The Crown Fire was a wildfire that scorched 13,918 acres (5,632 ha) of land in Los Angeles County, California. The second largest fire of the 2010 California wildfire season, the fire also destroyed 10 residences.As the fire advanced on July 30, it jumped the California Aqueduct and progressed towards homes in Palmdale.The cause of the blaze was ultimately traced to a lot in Agua Dulce where workers were using a hammer to extract bolts from a tire rim and created sparks.
The West Fire was a wildfire that scorched 1,650 acres (670 ha) of land in Kern County, California. While not one of the largest fires on the 2010 California wildfire season, the West Fire was the most destructive with 50 separate structured being destroyed.

The fire destroyed important habitat for the greater sage-grouse as well as a single barn. On August 30, 2012, the Rush Fire was 100% contained.
The 2013 California wildfires consisted of 9,907 wildfires that burned at least 577,675 acres (2,337.77 km2) of land in the state of California, during 2013. The wildfires injured at least 125 people and killed at least 1, and caused over $218.15 million (2013 USD) in damage. These included several large, notable wildfires, including the Rim Fire, which became California's 3rd largest wildfire. One of the wildfires was also caused by the plane crash of the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 on July 6, 2013, which ignited a wildfire that burned around 1 acre of land.
The Clover Fire was a fatal wildfire in Shasta County, California. It burned from September 9 to September 15, 2013 in an area near the communities of Happy Valley and Igo, California, about 10 miles southwest of Redding. It burned more than 8,000 acres (3,200 ha) and caused one death and six injuries. Damages were estimated at $65 million. One man has been charged with arson in the case.
The Mountain Fire was a wildfire in July, 2013 in Riverside County, California, about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. It burned primarily in the San Jacinto Mountains in the San Bernardino National Forest. It started on July 15, 2013 at 1:43 PM near the junction of Highway 243 and Highway 74. It burned for 16 days on steep slopes of timber and chaparral above Palm Springs. Heavy rainfall, up to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), on July 21 helped bring the blaze under control. It was fully contained on July 30, 2013.CalFire investigators said the fire was caused by a failure of "some type of electrical equipment" on private property and was not related to utility company equipment. At the fire's peak there were 3,500 firefighters on the lines as well as 20 helicopters, 12 airplanes and 260 engines. The cost of fighting the fire was estimated at $25.8 million.For a time the fire threatened the town of Idyllwild and other small towns. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway and Mount San Jacinto State Park were closed due to unhealhful air quality, and many neighboring areas were warned of possible unhealthful air conditions. The fire reached to within 2 miles of Palm Springs, which was draped by a blanket of ash and smoke.Nearly 6,000 residents of the Idyllwild and Fern Valley areas were ordered to evacuate; those communities were not damaged by the fire and the evacuation orders were lifted July 21. Evacuation centers were set up at Hemet High School in Hemet, Hamilton High School in Anza and Beaumont High School in Cherry Valley.Evaluating the effect of the fire, scientists say it may prove to be healthy for the Mount San Jacinto environment, because in many areas it burned away the understory (leaf litter, brush and downed timber) while leaving the taller trees intact. Rich Minnich, a fire scientist from the University of California, Riverside, said this was a poster child for how Southern California wildfires should burn. "We got an old-growth forest that burned slowly in good weather," he said. "We got a fantastic house cleaning. Someone finally vacuumed the rugs." Ken Kietzer, a scientist with the California state parks, echoed the assessment, saying the fire appears to have worked out well for Mount San Jacinto State Park. "When the fire got into the park, it was for the most part not a crown fire. It was a creeping ground fire. That is going to be very favorable to reducing the buildup of ground fuels and thinning out some of the smaller, shade tolerant understory, which will probably in the long run be a benefit for the park."A team of researchers from the San Diego Natural History Museum had been in the area studying the flora and fauna of Mount San Jacinto for comparison with a similar study done 100 years earlier by zoologist Joseph Grinnell; they were forced by the fire to evacuate their research camp. They are finding that the forest is much more dense than it was 100 years ago, partly due to decades of fire suppression. The increased density has altered the animal population as well as making the area more susceptible to large, damaging fires.
The Powerhouse Fire was a wildfire in northern Los Angeles County, California mostly in the Angeles National Forest. It started at approximately 3:30 PM on May 30, 2013. It was 100% contained by June 10, 2013.The fire burned more than 30,000 acres and destroyed 53 structures, including 24 homes. At the fire's peak it threatened more than 1000 structures. Two thousand firefighters were deployed to fight the fire. The communities of Lake Hughes, Elizabeth Lake, and Green Valley were evacuated.The fire never posed a threat to urban areas because the majority of the blaze was located in Angeles National Forest. The Powerhouse Fire did pose a threat to local forests as well as to powerlines, watershed areas, and the habitats of threatened and endangered species.
The Rim Fire was a wildland fire that was started in a remote canyon in Stanislaus National Forest in California. This portion of the central Sierra Nevada spans Tuolumne and Mariposa counties. The fire started on August 17, 2013 during the 2013 California wildfire season. It was the third largest wildfire in California's history, having burned 257,314 acres (402.053 sq mi; 1,041.31 km2). It is also the largest wildfire on record in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. The Rim Fire was fully contained on Thursday, October 24, 2013 after a nine-week firefighting battle. More than a year passed before it was declared out on November 4th, 2014. Due to a lack of winter rains, some logs smoldered in the interior portion of the fire throughout the winter.The fire was caused by a hunter's illegal fire that got out of control, and it was named for its proximity to the Rim of the World vista point, a scenic overlook on Highway 120 leading up to Yosemite. A total of eleven residences, three commercial buildings, and 98 outbuildings were destroyed in the fire. A total of ten injuries from the wildfire were also reported, but no firefighters were killed during the suppression efforts. Putting out the fire cost more than $127 million (2013 USD).
The Springs Fire was a wildfire in Ventura County and Los Angeles County, California in May 2013. Although the fire burned only 15 homes, it threatened 4,000. This threat passed when rain shower moved through the California area because of a low-pressure system off the coast. Some places got more than half an inch of rain.The fire started at 6:45 AM on May 2, 2013, in Camarillo, California near U.S. Route 101 and burned across Pacific Coast Highway to the Pacific Ocean. Several neighborhoods were evacuated, along with the campus of California State University Channel Islands.The fire burned around 24,000 acres of brushland along coastal Ventura County and into the Santa Monica Mountains. Weather conditions made favorable conditions for brush fires. The Santa Ana Winds were blowing at 40 to 50 miles per hour, spreading the fire; single-digit humidity added to the problems. By May 3, the fire was only 20 percent contained; on May 4, higher humidity made firefighters jobs easier; and on May 5 the fire was 60 percent contained. On May 6, 2013, the fire was almost extinguished as rain fell in the area.
The 2014 California wildfire season saw several notable wildfires ignited in the state of California, especially during the month of May, when multiple fires were ablaze concurrently in Southern California, and during September, when several massive wildfires were burning in Northern California. In the context of the 2012–15 North American drought (especially the 2011–15 California drought), as well as powerful Santa Ana winds, weather conditions were ideal for wildfires. The season began unusually early when a wildfire ignited on January 1, followed by 6 more fires igniting later within the same month. During a heat wave and dry Santa Ana conditions in May 2014, multiple wildfires broke out simultaneously in San Diego County, along with several other wildfires elsewhere in California. By mid-May, fire officials said they had already dealt with 1,400 wildfires in California in 2014 - twice the normal amount for that time of year - and a spokesman for CAL FIRE described the conditions as "unprecedented." The May 2014 San Diego County wildfires were estimated to have caused at least $60 million (2014 USD) in damage. In late June to early August, another group of wildfires ignited across the state, some of which reached over twenty thousand acres in size. In mid-September, the largest group of wildfires erupted, with some wildfires becoming larger than 50,000 acres in size. In early September 2014, the Happy Complex Fire became the largest wildfire of the season, eventually topping out at 135,369 acres (54,782 ha) in size on September 27. On October 8, an aerial tanker crashed during a firefighting effort at the Dog Rock Fire, which killed the pilot and sparked a small wildfire. From late September to late October, the latest flare-up of major wildfires were extinguished by cooler weather and precipitation. From December 10–13, a powerful winter storm extinguished the remaining wildfires that were present. In mid-December through late December, several more small wildfires sparked, but they were all extinguished by December 31. A total of 5,620 wildfires ignited throughout the year, which burned at least 631,434 acres (2,555.32 km2) of land. The wildfires caused a total of 146 injuries and 2 fatalities, in addition to causing at least $184.02 million (2014 USD) in damage.
The Bernardo Fire was a wildfire that occurred during the May 2014 San Diego County wildfire outbreak. The first started on May 13, at 10:00 AM PDT, just south of Del Norte High School, in a construction trench off Nighthawk Lane. Over the next few hours, the wildfire intensified, due to the strong Santa Ana winds driving it southward. This prompted the evacuation of several schools (with the exception of Del Norte High School), in addition to at least 20,000 homes. Within several hours, the fire covered at least 800 acres (320 ha) and was only 5% contained. The rapid southward spread of the fire caused mandatory evacuation orders to be issued for portions of 4S Ranch, Del Sur, Black Mountain Ranch, Rancho Santa Fe, and other residential communities. Late on May 13, the Bernardo Fire reached a size of 1,600 acres (650 ha). By 12:00 AM PDT on May 14, the portion of the fire within 4S Ranch and Del Sur had been completely extinguished, which was about 25% of the Bernardo Fire's 1,600 acre blaze. Later on May 14, all of the evacuation orders were lifted.On Wednesday, May 14, at 6 PM PDT, the wildfire was 50% contained. By the next morning, it was reported as 75% contained and no longer expanding. On May 16, the Bernardo Fire was reported to be 90% contained, but some structures were still threatened by the fire. On May 17, the fire was 95% contained, without having expanded any further. On May 17, at 8:14 PM PDT, the Bernardo Fire was reported to be 100% contained.The San Diego Unified School District closed all its schools citywide on May 15, but reopened most of them the following day.The cause of the Bernardo Fire has been ruled to be accidental; authorities said that it started in a small trench being dug by a construction crew and spread rapidly through the dry brush at the site.
The Boles Fire was a wildfire that burned in Siskiyou County during mid-September 2014. On September 15, at 1:38 PM PDT, the Boles Fire ignited near Weed, California. At 10:30 PM PDT, later on the same day, the Boles Fire was reported at 350 acres and 15% containment. Over 100 structures were reported damaged or destroyed on that day. Later that day, the wildfire was reported at nearly 100% containment; however, this report turned out to be erroneous. On September 16, the Boles Fire had burned 375 acres (152 ha) and was only 20% contained. It also destroyed 150 residences and forced the evacuation of 1,500 people in Weed and Siskiyou County.During the next couple of days, the Boles Fire increased to 479 acres (194 ha), before finally being fully contained on September 20. The wildfire also caused 1 injury. The Boles Fire destroyed a total of 150 residential structures and 8 nonresidential commercial properties, while damaging 4 single residences and 3 nonresidential commercial properties. The damage caused by the Boles Fire is currently unknown. The cause of the wildfire was reported as "under investigation."Ronald Beau Marshall was charged with arson in the Boles Fire case. As of December 5, 2014, Marshall was subject to a preliminary hearing in the matter.
The Bully Fire was a wildfire that started on July 11, at 3:37 PM PDT in Shasta County. The fire quickly spread to 700 acres (2.8 km2), and it was only 5% contained. During the next day, dry weather coupled with a heat wave allowed to fire to advance to 1,800 acres (7.3 km2), prompting mandatory evacuations to be issued for the region, as well as several miles of road closures. During the next few days, the wildfire exploded to 8,700 acres (35 km2), prompting additional evacuations, since the wildfire was only 25% contained. A couple of days later, the Bully Fire reached 11,700 acres (47 km2), but the containment also increased to 45%. By July 18, the wildfire had expanded further to 12,661 acres (5,124 ha), with the containment only at 65%. During the next few days, containment gradually increased to 95%, before progress stalled on July 22. However, the increase in containment allowed the road closures and the evacuation orders to be lifted. During the next 4 days, firefighting efforts continued to slowly extinguish the Bully Fire, until full containment of the perimeter was achieved on July 26, at 8:00 PM PDT. Fire patrols lingered for the next couple of days to work on extinguishing the blaze, and on July 28, the Bully Fire was reported to be 100% controlled. During its duration, the Bully Fire destroyed a total of 20 residential structures. A total of 21 injuries were also reported by the fire which was determined to be human-caused.
The Cocos Fire, originally known as the Twin Oaks Fire, was a wildfire that ignited on May 14 in San Marcos, in the hills south of California State University, San Marcos. The Cocos Fire quickly spread into western Escondido. The fire destroyed more than 40 buildings, including a dozen single-family homes. The Harmony Grove Spiritualist Association, a 13-acre spiritualist retreat founded in 1896, was particularly hard hit; most of the buildings and residences on the property were destroyed, and the association's president said, "We're pretty much wiped out." Property damage from the fire is estimated at more than $5.7 million. Three minor injuries have been reported.The Cocos Fire began at 5:38 PM PDT on May 14, and it had burned 400 acres (160 ha) by the evening of the same day.

The fire started on January 16, 2014 and eventually burned 1,992 acres. On January 25, the Colby Fire had burned 1,962 acres, and was 98% contained. The fire, which was fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, destroyed 5 homes, injured one person, and forced the evacuation of 3,600 people at its peak.Three men in their early 20s were arrested for recklessly starting a fire, and have allegedly admitted starting an illegal campfire that blew out of control. They will face federal charges of unlawfully causing timber to burn. Bail has been set at $500,000 for each of them "due to the seriousness of the crime, as well as the high cost of damaged property and resources to fight the fire." One of the men, a transient, has been placed in a residential drug treatment facility. Two of the homeless men were convicted of lighting and failing to control an illegal campfire; the third person is scheduled to go to trial later in 2014.January fires are unusual in Southern California, but there was little rainfall in the area leading up to the fire, which led to a "red flag" fire danger situation. Warm temperatures, low humidity, and an excess of dry brush in the foothills around Glendora (which had not burned significantly since the 1960s) encouraged the growth of the fire.
The Etiwanda Fire was a wildfire in the San Bernardino National Forest in the foothills north of Rancho Cucamonga. The fire started on April 30, 2014, during Santa Ana wind conditions of high temperatures and strong winds. On the first day, four schools and more than 1,500 homes were evacuated; residential evacuation orders were canceled that evening.

The May 2014 San Diego County wildfires were a swarm of 14 wildfires that erupted during May 2014, in San Diego County, California, during severe Santa Ana Wind conditions, historic drought conditions, and a heat wave. The main event during mid-May was preceded by a precursor fire that ignited on May 5. The Bernardo Fire has been declared accidental, and officials believe the Cocos Fire was intentionally set. The causes of the other fires are still under investigation by multiple agencies, and a joint task force was formed to coordinate the investigations and facilitate communications. Six injuries and one fire-related fatality were reported.At least eight major (named) fires were burning simultaneously at the height of the event, as well as several unnamed small brush fires. Smoke from the fires prompted health advisories in parts of Orange and Los Angeles counties.On May 14, the County of San Diego declared a local emergency. Later that evening, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for the county and affected areas.Multiple school districts, California State University at San Marcos, MiraCosta College and Palomar College were forced to cancel classes and close schools for one or more days; CSUSM and Palomar also postponed or cancelled commencement exercises due to the fires.

On June 18, the fire was 90% contained. Soon afterwards, many of the firefighters were withdrawn in order to prepare for possible future wildfire outbreaks, due to an approaching heat wave in which temperatures were expected to be in the hundreds. During the same day, the administration of Sequoia National Forest stated that the Shirley Fire was expected to continue burning within the containment line for the next several days, due to continuing drought conditions, an approaching heat wave, and the amount of timber the fire could consume as fuel within its perimeter. On June 20, it was reported that the perimeter of the Shirley Fire was 100% contained, but the wildfire continued to burn well inside of its perimeter while producing moderate amounts of smoke, which was expected to continue for the next several days. The firefighting efforts and the damage caused by the wildfire cost a total of $12,155,450 dollars (2014 USD). On June 21, the USAD Forest Service and the DOI Bureau of Land Management worked together to initiate cleanup efforts, assess the damage caused by the Shirley Fire, and assist in recovery efforts. The two agencies also worked to help bring the Shirley Fire under control, as well as to help the wildlife recover, and to prevent further degradation of resources. At 6:00 PM PDT on June 26, the roadblocks issued for the Shirley Fire were lifted, even though the wildfire continued to burn within the containment line. On July 15, the Shirley Fire was 100% controlled.
