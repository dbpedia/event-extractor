The Rhodes earthquake of 226 BC, which affected the island of Rhodes, Greece, is famous for having toppled the large statue known as the Colossus of Rhodes. Following the earthquake, the statue lay in place for nearly eight centuries before being sold off by invaders. While 226 BC is most often cited as the date of the quake, sources variously cite 226 or 227 BC as dates when it occurred.
The 426 BC Malian Gulf tsunami was a tsunami devastating the coasts of the Malian and Euboean Gulfs, Greece, in the summer of 426 BC. Thucydides inquired into its causes, and concluded that the tsunami must have been caused by an earthquake, He was thus the first to describe the cause of tsunamis. Herodotus, in contrast, had attributed the Potidaea tsunami to the divine wrath of Poseidon.
The Sparta earthquake of 464 BC destroyed much of Sparta, a city-state of ancient Greece. Historical sources suggest that the death toll may have been as high as 20,000, although modern scholars suggest that this figure is likely an exaggeration. The earthquake sparked a revolt of the helots, the slave class of Spartan society. Events surrounding this revolt led to an increase in tension between Sparta and their rival Athens and the cancellation of a treaty between them. After the troops of a relief expedition dispatched by conservative Athenians were sent back with cold thanks, Athenian democracy itself fell into the hands of reformers and moved toward a more populist and anti-Spartan policy. Therefore, this earthquake is cited by historical sources as one of the key events that led up to the First Peloponnesian War.
The 551 Beirut earthquake occurred on 9 July 551. It had an estimated magnitude of about 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of X (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a devastating tsunami which affected the coastal towns of Byzantine Phoenicia, causing great destruction and sinking many ships. Overall large numbers of people were reported killed, with one estimate of 30,000 by Antoninus of Piacenza for Beirut alone.
The 557 Constantinople earthquake took place on the night of December 14. This earthquake, described in the works of Agathias, John Malalas and Theophanes the Confessor, caused great damage to Constantinople, then capital of the Byzantine Empire, and a region frequently afflicted with earthquakes. More minor quakes had preceded the large event, including two in April and October respectively. The main quake in December was of unparalleled ferocity, and "almost completely razed" the city. It caused damage to the Hagia Sophia which contributed to the collapse of its dome the next year, as well as damaging the walls of Constantinople to the extent that Hun invaders were able to penetrate it with ease the following season.
The 526 Antioch earthquake hit Syria (region) and Antioch in the Byzantine Empire in 526. It struck during late May, probably between May 20–29, at mid-morning, killing approximately 250,000 people. The earthquake was followed by a fire that destroyed most of the buildings left standing by the earthquake. The maximum intensity in Antioch is estimated to be between VIII (Severe) and IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
A devastating earthquake known in the scientific literature as the Earthquake of 749 struck on January 18, 749 in areas of the Umayyad Caliphate, the worst affected being parts of Palestine and western Transjordan. The cities of Tiberias, Beit She'an, Hippos and Pella were largely destroyed while many other cities across the Levant were heavily damaged. The casualties numbered in the tens of thousands.In Jewish sources this earthquake is known, in Hebrew, as רעש שביעית, Ra'ash Shevi'it, lit. "seventh noise", interpreted by scholars to mean The Earthquake of the Sabbatical Year, because 749 was a sabbatical year, literally "the seventh year" in the Jewish calendar.
The 869 Sanriku earthquake (貞観地震, Jōgan jishin) and associated tsunami struck the area around Sendai in the northern part of Honshu on 9 July (26th day of 5th month, 11th year of Jōgan). The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of at least 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, but may have been as high as 9.0, similar to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The tsunami caused widespread flooding of the Sendai plain, with sand deposits being found up to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from the coast.
Several earthquake catalogues and historical sources describe the 893 Ardabil earthquake as a destructive earthquake that struck the city of Ardabil (in Iran), on 23 March 893. The magnitude was unknown but the death toll was reported to be very large. The USGS in their 'list of Earthquakes with 50,000 or More Deaths' give an estimate that 150,000 were killed, which would make it the ninth deadliest earthquake in history.However, although the Ardabil area is prone to numerous earthquakes and was struck by a major earthquake in 1997, the 893 event is considered to be a 'mistaken' earthquake based on misreadings of the original Armenian sources for the 893 Dvin earthquake, due to confusion caused by the Arabic name for Dvin, 'Dabil'.
The 893 Dvin earthquake occurred on 28 December at around midnight. It had a magnitude of approximately 6 and a maximum intensity of approximately IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It destroyed the city of Dvin in Armenia, causing approximately 30,000 casualties. The similarity of the Arabic name for Dvin, 'Dabil' to Ardabil in northwestern Iran, has caused confusion in written records, such that the 893 Ardabil earthquake appears in several catalogues, although it is regarded as a fake event. It was also recorded as an event during the classical period of India in several early catalogues at an unspecified capital.
The 847 Damascus earthquake occurred (probably on 24 November) in AD 847. Recent scholarship suggests that the earthquake was part of a multiple earthquake stretching from Damascus to the south, to Antioch in the north and to Mosul in the east. There were an estimated 20,000 casualties in Antioch according to the 13th-century historian and writer Al-Dhahabi, and 50,000 in Mosul. It is thought to be one of the most powerful earthquakes along the Dead Sea Transform.
The 856 Damghan earthquake or the 856 Qumis earthquake occurred on 22 December, 856 AD (242 A.H.). The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.9, and a maximum intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The meizoseismal area (area of maximum damage) extended for about 350 kilometres (220 mi) along the southern edge of the eastern Alborz mountains of present-day Iran including parts of Tabaristan and Gorgan. The earthquake's epicenter is estimated to be close to the city of Damghan, which was then the capital of the Persian province of Qumis. It caused approximately 200,000 deaths and is listed by the USGS as the sixth deadliest earthquake in recorded history.
The 1068 Near East earthquake occurred on the morning of March 18 in the Near East along the southern portion of the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system. The event was responsible for an estimated 20,000 deaths and caused damage in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and other areas east of the Mediterranean Sea. Other strong earthquakes that have occurred on the same southern portion of the DST have also impacted the region.
The 1088 Tmogvi earthquake (Georgian: თმოგვის მიწისძვრა) occurred on April 16 or April 22, 1088, on Easter Sunday, in the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Georgia. It takes its name from the castle of Tmogvi, in Javakheti, whose destruction is specifically noted in the medieval annals of Georgia. Its magnitude is estimated as 6.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale.
The 1185 East Midlands earthquake happened in England. It is the first earthquake in England for which there are reliable reports indicating damage. The moment magnitude of the shock was estimated to be above 5.0 and its intensity was placed at VII (Damaging) on the European macroseismic scale.
The 1138 Aleppo earthquake was among the deadliest earthquakes in history. Its name was taken from the city of Aleppo, in northern Syria, where the most casualties were sustained. The quake occurred on 11 October 1138 and was preceded by a smaller quake on the 10th. It is frequently listed as the third deadliest earthquake in history, following on from the Shensi and Tangshan earthquakes in China. However, the figure of 230,000 dead is based on a historical conflation of this earthquake with earthquakes in November 1137 on the Jazira plain and the large seismic event of 30 September 1139 in the Transcaucasian city of Ganja. The first mention of a 230,000 death toll was by Ibn Taghribirdi in the fifteenth century.
The 1157 Hama earthquake occurred on 12 August and may have resulted in tens of thousands deaths. Its name was taken from the city of Hama, in west-central Syria (region) (then under the Seljuk Empire rule), where the most casualties were sustained. The earthquake also affected Christian monasteries and churches in the vicinity of Jerusalem.
The 1169 Sicily earthquake occurred on 4 February, in the year 1169, at 07:00 on the eve of the feast of St. Agatha of Sicily (in southern Italy). It had an estimated magnitude of between 6.4 and 7.3 and an estimated maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Catania, Lentini and Modica were severely damaged. It triggered a tsunami. Overall, the earthquake is estimated to have caused the deaths of at least 15,000 people.
A powerful earthquake, rated at VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, struck northern Italy and Germany on 3 January 1117. The epicentre of the first shock was near Verona, the city which suffered the most damage. The outer wall of the amphitheatre was partially felled, and the standing portion was damaged in a later earthquake of 1183. Many other churches, monasteries, and ancient monuments were destroyed or seriously damaged, eliminating much of Verona's early medieval architecture and providing space for a massive Romanesque rebuilding. After the first shock of 3 January, seismic activity persisted for months, striking on 12 January, 4 June, 1 July, 1 October, and 30 December.The earthquake was not only felt in Verona but across northern Italy, from Cividale to Pavia, south to Pisa and north to Switzerland. Outside of Verona the most damaged areas were Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Venice, Treviso, Modena, Parma, and Cremona. The main churches of Padua all suffered major damages. News of the earthquake reached Montecassino and Reims. The Milanese chronicler Landolfo Iuniore reported that the church synods needed to be carried out in the open air, due to the destruction. In Germany, damage was also extensive. The Michaelskirche in Bamberg, the abbey at Brauweiler, and buildings in Rottenburg am Neckar, Constance, Meersburg, and Fénis were all reported damaged.Recent studies, however, suggest that it was not a major, single event on 3 January, but instead a series of powerful shocks in the areas of Verona (west Veneto) and Cremona (Lower Lombardy), which happened in a few days or even in a few hours. Other earthquakes may have hit as far south as Pisa (northwest Tuscany) and as north as Augsburg (southwest Bavaria), as distinct events, in the same days.
The 1202 Syria earthquake struck at about dawn on 20 May 1202 (598 AH) with an epicenter in southwestern Syria. Up to 1,100,000 deaths have been associated with this earthquake, although other estimates are much smaller. It was felt over a very wide area, from Sicily to Mesopotamia and Anatolia to upper Egypt, mostly affecting the Ayyubid Sultanate and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The cities of Tyre, Acre and Nablus were heavily damaged. A magnitude of Ms = 7.6 has been estimated with damage up to XI on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1222 Cyprus earthquake occurred at about 06:15 UTC on 11 May. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.0–7.5 and triggered a tsunami that was recorded in Libya and Alexandria. The strongest shaking was felt in Nicosia, Limassol and Paphos.
The 1222 Brescia earthquake occurred on Christmas Day in the year 1222. The chronicler Salimbene de Adam records that it was so powerful that the inhabitants of Brescia left their city en masse and camped outside, so that the falling buildings would not crush them.
The 1290 Chihli earthquake occurred on 27 September with an epicenter near Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia, Yuan dynasty. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (violent) on the mercalli intensity scale. One estimate places the death toll at 7,270, while another has it at 100,000.
The Cilicia earthquake occurred northeast of the city of Adana in 1268. Over 60,000 people perished in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in southern Asia Minor.
The 1293 Kamakura earthquake in Japan occurred at about 06:00 local time on 27 May 1293. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.1–7.5 and triggered a tsunami. The estimated death toll was 23,024. It occurred during the Kamakura period, and the city of Kamakura was seriously damaged.In the confusion following the quake, Hōjō Sadatoki, the Shikken of the Kamakura Shogunate, carried out a purge against his subordinate Taira no Yoritsuna. In what is referred to as the Heizen Gate Incident, Yoritsuna and 90 of his followers were killed.It has been suggested that the reference to a large tsunami may be incorrect, although a tsunami deposit has been found that is consistent with this age.
The 1303 Crete earthquake occurred at about dawn on 8 August. It had an estimated magnitude of about 8, a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale and triggered a major tsunami that caused severe damage and loss of life on Crete and at Alexandria.
The 1348 Friuli earthquake, centered in the South Alpine region of Friuli, was felt across Europe on January 25. The quake hit in the same year that the Great Plague ravaged Italy. According to contemporary sources, it caused considerable damage to structures; churches and houses collapsed, villages were destroyed and foul odors emanated from the earth.
The Basel earthquake of 18 October 1356 is the most significant seismological event to have occurred in Central Europe in recorded history and had a moment magnitude in the range of 6.0–7.1. This earthquake is also known as the 'Séisme de la Saint-Luc', as 18 October is the feast day of Saint Luke the Evangelist.
The 1343 earthquake struck the Tyrrhenian Sea and Bay of Naples on November 25, 1343. Underground shocks were felt in Naples and caused significant damage and loss of lives. Of major note was a tsunami created by the earthquake which destroyed many ships in Naples and destroyed many ports along the Amalfi Coast including Amalfi itself. The effects of the tsunami were observed by the poet Petrarch, whose ship was forced to return to port, and recorded in the fifth book of his Epistolae familiares.
The Catalan earthquake of 2 February 1428, known in Catalan as the terratrèmol de la candelera because it took place during the Candlemas, struck the region of Catalonia, especially Roussillon, with an epicentre near Camprodon. The earthquake was one of a series of related seismic events that shook Catalonia in a single year. Beginning on 23 February 1427, tremors were felt in March, April, 15 May at Olot, June, and December. They caused relatively minor visible damage to property, notably to the monastery of Amer; but they probably caused severe weakening of building infrastructure. This would account for the massive and widespread destruction that accompanied the subsequent 1428 quake.Modern estimates of the intensity are VIII (Damaging) or IX (Destructive) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The ramparts of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste were destroyed. The clocktower of Arles-sur-Tech collapsed. The monastery of Fontclara at Banyuls-dels-Aspres was devastated. The damage sustained by the monastery of Saint-Martin-du-Canigou marked the commencement of its decline. The belltower and Lantern tower of Sant Joan de les Abadesses fell down. The chapel at Núria was destroyed. The villages of Tortellà and Queralbs were entirely destroyed. Among the damaged structures were Santa Maria de Ripoll and Sant Llorenç prop Bagà. As far away as Perpignan and Barcelona the populace was gripped by panic. In the latter, the intensity was estimated at VI (Strong) or VII (Very strong). The rose window of the Gothic church of Santa Maria del Mar was destroyed.Robin de Molhet, lord of Peyrepertuse, who was travelling in his domains when the earthquake struck, quickly came to the aid of victims, which earned the recognition of Alfonso V of Aragon, who was away in Valencia at the time of the tremors. He was informed by the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Felip de Malla, in a letter. It is estimated that hundreds of people were killed in the disaster: two hundred are estimated at Camprodon, one to three hundred at Puigcerdà (due to the collapse of the church), twenty to thirty at Barcelona (in Santa Maria del Mar), and almost the entire population of Queralbs. The fallout lasted well over a year. The quake was probably the worst in the history of the Pyrenees, though the first recorded only occurred in 1373. It remains to this day a point of reference for the study of seismic risk.
The 1481 Rhodes earthquake occurred at 3:00 in the morning on 3 May. It triggered a small tsunami, which caused local flooding. There were an estimated 30,000 casualties. It was the largest of a series of earthquakes that affected Rhodes, starting on 15 March 1481, continuing until January 1482.
The 1498 Nankai earthquake (明応地震 Meiō Jishin) occurred off the coast of Nankaidō, Japan, at about 08:00 local time on 20 September 1498. It had a magnitude estimated at 8.6 MS and triggered a large tsunami. The death toll associated with this event is uncertain, but between 26,000 and 31,000 casualties were reported. A tsunami caused by the Meiō Nankaidō earthquake washed away the building housing the statue of the Great Buddha at Kōtoku-in in Kamakura.
The 1509 Constantinople earthquake, referred to as "The Lesser Judgment Day" (Turkish: Küçük Kıyamet or Kıyamet-i Suğra) by contemporaries, occurred in the Sea of Marmara on 10 September 1509 at about 10pm. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.2 ± 0.3 on the surface wave magnitude scale. A tsunami and forty-five days of aftershocks followed the earthquake. Over a thousand houses and 109 mosques were destroyed, and an estimated 10,000 people died.
The 1511 Idrija earthquakes (Slovene: Idrijski potres) occurred on March 26 with a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). Fifteen people were killed and damage was considered severe.
The 1522 Vila Franca earthquake, alternately the 1522 Vila Franca landslide (Portuguese: Subversão de Vila Franca or Terramoto de Vila Franca) refers to the great earthquake and landslides that occurred between 21–22 October 1522, in the municipality of Vila Franca do Campo (then provincial capital), on the island of São Miguel, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores.The earthquakes' epicentre were situated several kilometres north-northwest of Vila Franca, and had a maximum intensity of X (Very destructive) on the European macroseismic scale. This resulted in the movement of landforms above the settlement, resulting in landslides and lahar that moved 6,750,000 cubic metres (238,000,000 cu ft) of material down the surrounding slopes, causing the destruction of buildings, deaths and inundated the settlement with debris. As a consequence almost the entirety of the settlement, between 3000 and 5000 people, were killed. In addition to the destruction of Vila Franca, the earthquake affected the neighbouring settlements, including Ponta Garça, Maia and Porto Formoso (where thousands were killed). A tsunami formed by the lahar caused the destruction of several boats that were located near the islet of Vila Franca, and the death of at most a hundred people. Gaspar Frutuoso, writing 70 years following the destruction, remembered a complete record of the events, writing a oral romance on Vila Franca.
The 1531 Lisbon earthquake occurred in the Kingdom of Portugal on the morning of 26 January 1531, between 4 and 5 o'clock. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami resulted in approximately 30,000 deaths.
The 1570 Ferrara earthquake struck the Italian city of Ferrara on November 16 and 17, 1570. After the initial shocks, an earthquake swarm continued for four years, with over 2000 aftershocks concentrated from November 1570 to February 1571.The same area was struck, centuries later, by another major earthquake of comparable intensity.The disaster destroyed half the city, permanently marked many of the buildings left standing, and directly contributed to – but was not the sole cause of – a long-term decline of the city lasting until the 19th century.The earthquake caused the first documented episode of soil liquefaction in the Po Valley, and one of the oldest occurrences of the event known outside of paleoseismology. It led to the establishment of an earthquake observatory which published to very high regard, and the drafting of some of the first-known building designs based on a scientific seismic-resistant approach.
On April 2, 1582 Ancuancu (in present-day La Paz Department, Bolivia) was struck by an earthquake, that reportedly buried all of the inhabitants except for one chief who reportedly lost the ability to speak. On the place where the village had stood, the Jacha Kalla (Achocalla) valley was formed as a result of the earthquake.
The 1570 Concepción earthquake occurred at 9:00, on February 8, 1570. The strong earthquake destroyed Concepción, Chile. It was accompanied by a tsunami, and aftershocks were felt for months. According to NOAA at least 2000 lives were lost and every house was destroyed. Because of a delay between the earthquake and the tsunami, much of the population was able to escape to higher ground.The earthquake's magnitude was 8.3 Ms, located at 36°48′S 73°00′W.
Though severe earthquakes in the north of France and Britain are rare, the 1580 Dover Straits earthquake appears to have been one of the largest in the recorded history of England, Flanders or northern France. It occurred at around 20:00 British time.
The Neulengbach earthquake of 1590 occurred on 15 September shortly before midnight amidst a long series of much weaker seismic activity starting on 29 June and with aftershocks reported until 12 November. It was the strongest historically documented earthquake in what today is Northeastern Austria.
The 1556 Shaanxi earthquake (Chinese: 华县大地震; pinyin: Huáxiàn Dàdìzhèn) or Jiajing earthquake (Chinese: 嘉靖大地震; pinyin: Jiājìng Dàdìzhèn) was a catastrophic earthquake and is also the deadliest earthquake on record, killing approximately 830,000 people. It occurred on the morning of 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, during the Ming Dynasty. More than 97 counties in the provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu and Anhui were affected. Buildings were damaged slightly in the cities of Beijing, Chengdu and Shanghai. An 840-kilometre-wide (520 mi) area was destroyed, and in some counties as much as 60% of the population was killed. Most of the population in the area at the time lived in yaodongs, artificial caves in loess cliffs, many of which collapsed with catastrophic loss of life.
The 1575 Valdivia earthquake occurred at 14:30 local time on December 16. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale and led to the flood of Valdivia, Chile.Pedro Mariño de Lobera, who was corregidor of Valdivia by that time, wrote that the waters of the river opened like the Red Sea, one part flowing upstream and one downstream. Mariño de Lobera also evacuated the city until the dam at Laguna de Anigua (nowadays Riñihue Lake) burst. At that moment he wrote that, while many Indians died, no Spaniards did, as the settlement of Valdivia was moved temporarily away from the riverside.The effects of this earthquake are similar to the 1960 Valdivia earthquake that also caused ensuing Riñihuazo flooding. These similarities show that large earthquakes have a pattern that span over several centuries.
This list of 20th-century earthquakes is a global list of notable earthquakes that occurred in the 20th century. After 1900 most earthquakes have some degree of instrumental records and this means that the locations and magnitudes are more reliable than for earlier events. To prevent this list becoming unmanageable, only those of magnitude 6 and above should be included unless they are notable for some other reason.
The following is a list of significant earthquakes during the 21st century, listing earthquakes of magnitude 7 and above, or which caused fatalities. Deaths due to earthquake-caused tsunamis are included. In terms of fatalities, the 2010 Haiti earthquake was the most destructive event, followed by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, 2005 Pakistan earthquake and 2008 Sichuan earthquake.For lists of earthquakes by country, which may include smaller and less destructive events than those listed here, see Lists of earthquakes by country.
The 1611 Sanriku earthquake (慶長三陸地震, Keichō Sanriku Jishin) occurred on December 2, 1611, with an epicenter off the Sanriku coast in Iwate Prefecture. The magnitude of the earthquake was 8.1M. It triggered a devastating tsunami. A description of this event in an official diary from 1612 is probably the first recorded use of the term 'tsunami'.
The 1615 Arica earthquake was a major earthquake centered near Arica in the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of Peru, within the present day Arica y Parinacota Region of northwestern Chile.The earthquake caused considerable damage to the infrastructure of the city with the Iglesia Mayor. The city's fort collapsed, and cracks opened in the floor of the royal quicksilver storage facility. No human was reported dead but three people suffered injuries.
The 1721 Tabriz earthquake occurred on April 26, with an epicenter near the city of Tabriz, Iran. Many prominent mosques and schools in the city were destroyed, resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of people. The total number of casualties caused by the earthquake is between 8,000 and 250,000; it was most likely approximately 80,000. At the time that it occurred, the earthquake was popularly interpreted as an omen of misfortune, or a demonstration of godly wrath. The destruction that the earthquake caused was a significant factor in the successful Ottoman takeover of Tabriz in 1722, as well as contributing to Tabriz's economic difficulties during that period. It also caused the destruction of some of the city's significant historical monuments. Accounts of the earthquake are often confused with descriptions of the 1727 Tabriz earthquake.
The 1730 Valparaíso earthquake occurred at 03:45 local time (08:45 UTC) on July 8. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.7 and triggered a major tsunami with an estimated magnitude of Mt=8.75, that inundated the lower parts of Valparaíso. The earthquake caused severe damage from La Serena to Chillan, while the tsunami affected more than 1,000 km (620 mi) of Chile's coastline.
The 1738 Vrancea earthquake occurred on 11 June [O.S. 31 May] 1738, during the third rule of Constantin Mavrocordat. The seism aroused great panic and is mentioned in several sources. It occurred in the lower lithospheric block, at a depth of 130 km. Its effects were violent on large areas, the hardest hit being Bucharest, where several houses and churches collapsed.The Romanian territories were not the only affected. In Niš, a Serbian city where the Ottoman army was quartered, the fortresses on the Danube partially collapsed, and in the Greek Nicopolis four mosques collapsed.At an estimated magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale, the earthquake of 1738 is one of the strongest in the Romanian history.
The 1762 Arakan earthquake occurred at about 17:00 local time on 2 April, with an epicentre somewhere on the coast from Chittagong (modern Bangladesh) to Arakan in modern Burma. It had an estimated magnitude of as high as 8.8 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum estimated intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a local tsunami in the Bay of Bengal and caused at least 200 deaths. The earthquake was associated with major areas of both uplift and subsidence.
The 1763 Komárom earthquake occurred in or near the town of Komárom in Komárom County in the Kingdom of Hungary on 28 June. The earthquake has been estimated at 6.2 to 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 1786 Kangding-Luding earthquake occurred on 1 June. It had an estimated magnitude of about 7.75 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Four-hundred and thirty-five people were killed during the mainshock. After an aftershock ten days later, a further 100,000 died when a landslide dam collapsed across the Dadu river.
The Ansei great earthquakes (安政の大地震, Ansei no Dai Jishin) were a series of three major earthquakes that struck Japan during the Ansei era (1854–1860).The Ansei Tōkai quake (安政東海地震, Ansei Tōkai Jishin) was an 8.4 magnitude earthquake which struck on December 23, 1854. The epicenter ranged from Suruga Bay to the deep ocean, and struck primarily in the Tōkai region, but destroyed houses as far away as in Edo. The accompanying tsunami caused damage along the entire coast from the Bōsō Peninsula in modern-day Chiba prefecture to Tosa province (modern-day Kōchi prefecture)The Ansei Nankai quake (安政南海地震, Ansei Nankai Jishin) was an 8.4 magnitude earthquake which struck on December 24, 1854. Over 10,000 people from the Tōkai region down to Kyushu were killed.The Ansei Edo quake (安政江戸地震, Ansei Edo Jishin) was a 6.9 magnitude earthquake which struck Edo (modern-day Tokyo) on November 11, 1855. One hundred and twenty earthquakes and tremors in total were felt in Edo in 1854-55. The great earthquake struck after 10 o'clock in the evening; roughly 30 aftershocks continued until dawn. The epicenter was near the mouth of the Arakawa River. Records from the time indicate 6,641 deaths inside the city, and 2,759 injuries; much of the city was destroyed by fire, leading many people to stay in rural inns. Aftershocks continued for twenty days. This quake was a particularly destructive deep thrust quake caused by a giant slab of rock stuck between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Pacific Plate.The earthquake was blamed on a giant catfish (Namazu) thrashing about. Ukiyo-e prints depicting namazu became very popular around this time.Other notable quakes to strike in the Ansei period include one in the Iga area, one which registered 7.4 on the Richter scale and struck Kyushu and Shikoku .The 1858 Hietsu earthquake struck the Hietsu area on April 9, 1858.
The 2000 Nicaragua earthquake occurred at 19:30 UTC on July 6. It had a magnitude of 5.4 on the moment magnitude scale and caused 7 deaths and 42 injuries. 357 houses were destroyed and 1,130 others were damaged in the earthquake.
The 2000 Baku earthquake occurred on November 25 at 22:10 (18:10 GMT) local time, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale in the epicentre and three minutes later followed by a quake measuring 5.9. It was the strongest for almost 160 years, since 1842 in the Baku suburbs and in addition to the capital affected Sumgayit, Shamakhi and neighboring cities. According to the United States Geological Survey, the epicentre was in the Caspian Sea, 25 km to the south-southeast of Baku. The earthquake was felt as far away as e.g. Tbilisi, 600 km northwest of the epicentre, Makhachkala and the Karabudakh and Isberbas settlements in Dagestan. It is assumed that the earthquake was triggered by active tectonic motion on the border of two major sections of the earth crust – the Turansk plate and the Kopedag-Caucasian folded plate motion area. The earthquake zone gravitates towards Apsheron-Chelekensk deep crust break.
The 2000 Iceland earthquakes struck southern Iceland on June 17 and 21. There were no fatalities but one person was injured and there was considerable damage to infrastructure. The two earthquakes were the first major seismic activity in Iceland for 88 years.
The 2000 Kipawa earthquake struck Quebec and Ontario, Canada with a moment magnitude of 5.2 at 6:22 a.m. on January 1. It occurred in the Western Quebec Seismic Zone. The main shock epicenter was located in Lake Kipawa about 10 km (6 mi) north of Témiscaming in southwestern Quebec and 70 km (43 mi) northeast of North Bay, Ontario. The shaking associated with this earthquake was strongest within 50 km (31 mi) of the epicenter. It was felt in Témiscaming, North Bay and as far away as Toronto, making it one of the most significant earthquakes in Canada in 2000. The earthquake was triggered by major thrust faults associated with the Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben.Minor damage was reported during this earthquake, including fallen light objects, a damaged ventilation pipe and fractures in plaster. The earthquake's epicenter was very close to the epicenter of the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake and lies in a group of 76 located earthquakes since 1935. A total of 17 aftershocks were recorded.
The 2000 New Ireland earthquakes occurred off the coast of New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea on November 16 and 17.The mainshock was a magnitude 8.0 Mw  strike-slip event that occurred on November 16 at 04:54 UTC, and ruptured a section of the transform boundary between the north and south Bismarck plates. A 7.8 magnitude  thrust earthquake followed at 07:42 UTC with its epicenter 175 km south of the first earthquake at the southern end of its rupture zone at 5.496°S 151.781°E﻿ / -5.496; 151.781. Another 7.8 magnitude  thrust event occurred on November 17 at 21:01 UTC, this time occurring 174 km south west of the initial event at 5.233°S 153.102°E﻿ / -5.233; 153.102 in eastern New Britain.This sequence of earthquakes killed two people, and triggered landslides in southern New Ireland. Damage caused by the events and the following tsunami occurred in New Britain, Duke of York Island, western Bougainville and Buka. The magnitude 8.0 event was the largest earthquake to occur in the world during 2000.
The 2000 Enggano earthquake struck at 23:28 local time on June 4 with a moment magnitude of 7.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). The strike-slip event occurred off the coast of southern Sumatra, Indonesia near Enggano Island. There were more than 100 fatalities and up to 2,585 injuries. Over 730 aftershocks shocked the area afterwards, one just eleven minutes after the mainshock.
The 2000 Tottori earthquake (鳥取地震 Tottorijishin) occurred at 13:30:20 local time with a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The epicenter was near Yonago and Matsue. About $150 million in damage was caused (with 104 buildings destroyed) and 130 people were injured.
The 2000 Turkmenistan earthquake took place at 8:11 p.m. Moscow Time on December 6 and had a magnitude of 7.0. The intensity of the earthquake reached VIII at its epicenter, and VI at the Turkmen capital of Ashgabat. The epicenter was located some 25 kilometers north of the city of Balkanabat and 125 kilometers southeast of Türkmenbaşy. There were unconfirmed reports that the quake killed up to 11 people and injured 5 others.
The 2000 Yountville earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 5 on a previously unmapped fault, about 3 miles (4.8 km) south southwest of Yountville, California in the Mayacamas Mountain Range under Mount Veeder and about 9 miles (14 km) south northwest of Napa, California. It occurred at 01:36 PDT (08:36 UTC) on September 3.
The 2000 Yunnan earthquake occurred on January 14 at 23:37 UTC, in Yunnan, China. The earthquake killed 7 people, and caused much damage in central Yunnan Province.The quake was moderate, with a magnitude of 5.9; however, it left 2,528 injured, 92,479 homeless and destroyed over 41,000 homes.It was preceded by a magnitude 5.5 foreshock at 22:09, and a 4.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in the same area on 26 January.
The February 2001 El Salvador earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.6 on 13 February at 14:22:05 UTC. The epicentre was 15 miles (30 km) E of San Salvador, El Salvador. At least 315 people were killed, 3,399 were injured, and extensive damage affected the area. Another 16,752 homes were damaged and 44,759 destroyed. The most severe damage occurred in the San Juan Tepezontes-San Vicente-Cojutepeque area, though it was felt throughout the country and in neighboring Guatemala and Honduras. Landslides occurred in many areas of El Salvador.
The January 2001 El Salvador earthquake struck El Salvador on January 13, 2001 at 17:33:34 UTC. The 7.6 (later estimated to be 7.7 or 7.9) quake struck with the epicenter 60 miles (100 km) SW of San Miguel, El Salvador (13.04°N 88.66°W) at a depth of 60 km. At least 944 people were killed, 5,565 injured, 108,261 houses destroyed — with another 169,692 houses damaged — and more than 150,000 buildings were damaged in El Salvador. About 585 of the deaths were caused by large landslides in Santa Tecla and Comasagua. As is often the case after earthquakes in El Salvador, landslides wreaked significant damage. Estimation of the number of slides is difficult because individual scarps conjoin. The total has been reported as high as 16,000, though it is unclear how this figure was arrived at. Damage and injuries occurred in every department of El Salvador, particularly the departments of La Libertad and Usulután. Eight people were killed in Guatemala. The tremor was felt from Mexico City to Colombia. An aftershock measuring 5.7 magnitude was felt on January 15, an event not widely reported outside the country until after the February quake, which initially was assessed by the USGS at 5.7 magnitude as well.As of February 2, 2001, more than 2,500 aftershocks had hit El Salvador, leading to additional damage and terrorizing the inhabitants. Clean water and sanitation became a matter of grave concern in many areas due to the earthquake's destruction of some $7 million to municipal drinking water systems, and tens of thousands of people were living outdoors in spite of the approaching rainy season (invierno). Government and public health organizations warned of the possible spread of disease as desperate people began to scavenge debris piles — some containing severed human limbs — looking for items they could pawn to purchase needed food and other commodities.
The 2001 Geiyo earthquake (2001年芸予地震 Nisen-ichi-nen Gēyo Jishin) occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.7 on March 24 at 15:27 local time near Hiroshima, Japan. One person in Hiroshima and one person in Ehime were reported dead. About 3,700 buildings were damaged in the Hiroshima area. Liquefaction was observed in Hiroshima and Ehime. Power outage occurred in the prefectures of Hiroshima, Ehime, Okayama, Yamaguchi, and Kōchi. The maximal intensity was shindo lower 6 in Hiroshima. This earthquake could be felt along the eastern and southern coasts of South Korea.The released seismic moment of the earthquake was 1.3×1019 Nm. This earthquake is a normal faulting in-slab event within the subducting Philippine Sea Plate. The slip of the earthquake was estimated to be about 1.5–2.4 meters (4 ft 11 in–7 ft 10 in). The locations of aftershocks were distributed roughly in N-S direction. It has been suggested that this earthquake was related to the dehydration of the Philippine Sea Plate slab.In this region, a strong earthquake occurred in 1905, which was also an in-slab event within the subducting plate.
The 2001 Gujarat earthquake also known as Bhuj earthquake occurred on 26 January, India's 52nd Republic Day, at 08:46 AM IST and lasted for over 2 minutes. The epicentre was about 9 km south-southwest of the village of Chobari in Bhachau Taluka of Kutch District of Gujarat, India. The intraplate earthquake reached 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake killed between 13,805 and 20,023 people (including 18 in southeastern Pakistan), injured another 167,000 and destroyed nearly 400,000 homes.
The 2001 Kunlun earthquake also known as the 2001 Kokoxili earthquake, occurred on 14 November 2001 at 09:26 UTC (17:26 local time), with an epicenter near Kokoxili, close to the border between Qinghai and Xinjiang in a remote mountainous region. With a magnitude of 7.8 Mw it was the most powerful earthquake in China for 5 decades. No casualties were reported, presumably due to the very low population density and the lack of high-rise buildings. This earthquake was associated with the longest surface rupture ever recorded on land, ~450 km.
The 2001 Nisqually earthquake (also commonly referred to as "The Ash Wednesday earthquake") occurred at 10:54:32 local time on February 28. The intraslab earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The epicenter was in the southern Puget Sound, northeast of Olympia, but the shock was felt in Oregon, Canada, eastern Washington, and Idaho. This was one of several large earthquakes that occurred in the Puget sound region in the prior 52 years and caused property damage valued at between one and four billion dollars. One person died of a heart attack and several hundred were injured.
The 2001 southern Peru earthquake occurred at 20:33:15 UTC (15:33:15 local time) on June 23 with a moment magnitude of 8.4 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The quake affected the Peruvian regions of Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna. It was the most devastating earthquake in Peru since the catastrophic 1970 Ancash earthquake and globally the largest earthquake since the 1965 Rat Islands earthquake.
The 2002 Burica earthquake occurred on July 30 at 19:16:48 local time off the coast of Panama. It had a magnitude of Mw 6.5. The epicenter was located off the southeastern coast of Burica Peninsula, close to the Costa Rica–Panama border. Some homes collapsed and at least 11 people were reported injured, both in Panama and in Costa Rica. The strongest intensity reached VII (Very strong) in Puerto Armuelles, Panama. It was felt with III (Weak) to IV (Light) around San Jose, Costa Rica. Shops in the center of Puerto Armuelles suffered from loss such as fallen merchandise and broken window glass. This earthquake occurred along the Panama Fracture Zone, which is a right lateral transform fault that marks the boundary between the Cocos Plate and the Nazca Plate.
The 2002 Denali earthquake occurred at 22:12:41 UTC (1:12 PM Local Time) November 3 with an epicenter 66 km ESE of Denali National Park, Alaska, United States. This 7.9 Mw earthquake was the largest recorded in the interior of the United States for more than 150 years. The shock was the strongest ever recorded in the interior of Alaska. Due to the remote location, there were no fatalities and only a few injuries.Due to the shallow depth, it was felt at least as far away as Seattle and it generated seiches on bodies of water as far away as New Orleans. About 20 houseboats were damaged by a seiche on a lake in Washington State.
The 2002 Dudley earthquake struck the West Midlands of United Kingdom on 22 September at 23:53 UTC (23 September, 00:53 local time). The shock registered 5.0 on the Richter scale and lasted approximately 20 seconds.It was the largest earthquake to hit the UK since the 1990 Bishop's Castle earthquake, but there were no injuries and only minor structural damage. The epicentre was located at the junction of High Arcal Road and Himley Road (grid reference SO898913) in the district of South Staffordshire, just outside the boundary of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, approximately two miles west of Dudley Town Centre.The tremor was felt over an area of 260,000 square kilometres (100,387 sq mi), including Wales, Liverpool, Derby, Yorkshire, Wiltshire and London. The furthest felt reports came from Carlisle in the north, and Truro in the South. An aftershock of magnitude 2.7 occurred on 23 September at 03:32 UTC (04:32 local time), and was felt locally throughout Dudley and in Birmingham.
The 2002 Hindu Kush earthquakes struck in northern Afghanistan during the month of March. At least 166 people were killed with a very large and intermediate-depth mainshock on March 3. Three weeks later, at least a further thousand were killed during a large, but shallow aftershock that had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The M7.4 and M6.1 reverse events were focused in the Hindu Kush mountain range area.
The 2002 Bou'in-Zahra earthquake (also known as the 2002 Avaj earthquake or the 2002 Changureh earthquake[a]) occurred on June 22, 2002. The epicenter was near the city[b] of Bou'in-Zahra[c] in Qazvin Province, a region of northwestern Iran which is crossed by several major faults that is known for destructive earthquakes. The shock measured 6.3 on the moment magnitude scale, had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), and was followed by more than 20 aftershocks. At least 261 people were killed and 1,500 more were injured.According to the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology (IIEES), the earthquake was felt as far away as the capital city of Tehran, approximately 290 kilometres (180 mi) east of the epicenter, although no damage was reported there. Most houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. The public became angry due to the slow official response to victims who needed supplies. Residents of the town of Avaj resorted to throwing stones at the car of a government minister.
The 2002 Kalehe earthquake occurred on October 24 at 06:08 UTC. This earthquake had a magnitude Mw 6.2, and the epicenter was located in Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Lake Kivu. Two people were reported dead. Building damage was reported in Goma, Lwiro, Kalehe, and Mugeri. The seismicity, volcanism, and uplift in the basin of Lake Kivu delimits the rift of a tectonic plate. Lake Kivu belongs to the western branch of the East African Rift System (EARS). The western branch is usually divided into several segments, and Lake Kivu belongs to the northern segment.
The 2002 Mindanao earthquake struck the Philippines on March 5. The sixth most powerful earthquake of the year, it registered a magnitude of 7.5 and was a megathrust earthquake. It originated near the Cotabato Trench, a zone of deformation situated between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Sunda Plate. The entire country is characterized by a high level of volcanic and seismic activity. The earthquake was responsible for 15 deaths and roughly 100 injuries. Up to 800 buildings were damaged as a result, many from a flood generated by landslides and falling debris. A tsunami followed the earthquake.
The 2002 Molise earthquake hit the Italian regions of Molise and Apulia on October 31 at 10:32:58 (UTC). The shock had a moment magnitude of 5.9 and a depth of 10.0 km (6.2 mi). Most of the victims were killed and injured when a school collapsed in the town of San Giuliano di Puglia: 26 of the 51 schoolchildren died, together with one of their teachers. In particular, none of the nine children in the school's 4th Year (mostly born in 1996) survived.
The 2002 Sumatra earthquake occurred at 01:26 UTC on 2 November. It had a magnitude of 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale with an epicenter just north of Simeulue island and caused three deaths. This earthquake is regarded as a foreshock of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which had an epicenter about 60 km to the northwest.
The 2003 Puerto Armuelles earthquake occurred on December 25, 2003 at 02:11 local time (07:11 UTC). The epicenter was located in Panama, at about 7 km east of Puerto Armuelles, near the Panama-Costa Rica border. The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 6.5. Two people were reported dead in Puerto Armuelles. There was building damage in Panama and Costa Rica. Power outage lasted for about 4 hours in Puerto Armuelles. The maximal intensity was MM VIII in Finca Naranjo, Costa Rica. The intensity was MM VII in Armuelles, Panama, and MM IV in Limón and the Central Valley, Costa Rica, including San José. This earthquake could also be felt in Panama City.
The 2003 Zhaosu earthquake, also known as the Syumbinskoe earthquake, occurred on December 1 at 01:38 UTC. The epicenter was located in the Almaty Region, Kazakhstan, near the Sino–Kazakh border. The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 6.0 and had a maximum observed intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The epicenter was close to the Zhaosu County, Xinjiang, where 10 people were reported dead, 73 people injured, and more than 800 buildings collapsed. Some people were evacuated in Zhaosu. The earthquake occurred in the cold winter, and the 30 cm ground snow covered the roads in the mountainous region and hindered the relief work.
The 2003 Alabama earthquake took place on April 29 at 3:59 A.M. Central Daylight Time (local time when the event occurred) eight miles (13 km) east-northeast of Fort Payne, Alabama. The number of people who felt this quake was exceptionally high as the earthquake could be felt in 11 states across the East Coast and as far north as southern Indiana. The earthquake was strongly felt throughout metropolitan Atlanta. The Georgia Building Authority was called out to inspect the historic Georgia State Capitol in downtown Atlanta and other state-owned buildings, but found no problems. However, this is not out of the ordinary as earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains can be felt several times the area felt on West Coast earthquakes. The earthquake was given a magnitude 4.6 on the moment magnitude scale by the USGS (other sources reported as high a magnitude as 4.9) and reports of the duration of the shaking range from 10 seconds to as long as 45 seconds. It is tied with a 1973 earthquake near Knoxville, Tennessee as the strongest earthquake ever to occur in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, which is the second most active seismic zone east of the Rocky Mountains, with the New Madrid Seismic Zone the most active.The April 29 earthquake caused moderate damage in northern Alabama including a 29-foot (8.8 m) wide sinkhole northwest of Fort Payne. The quake disrupted the local water supply. There were numerous reports of chimney damage, broken windows and cracked walls, particularly around the area near Hammondville, Mentone and Valley Head, Alabama. Many 9-1-1 call centers were overloaded with worrisome and panicked residents, who thought it was a train derailment, a bomb or some other type of explosion that had awakened them. There were several aftershocks, all of magnitude 2.0 or lower and were not widely felt.
The 2003 Bachu earthquake occurred on 24 February in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in northwest China. The epicentre was located near to the town of Jiashi and Bachu County, approximately 105 km east of Kashgar and 310 km west of Aksu. At least 261 people died as a result of the earthquake, and more than 4,000 were injured. Most of the casualties occurred in Bachu county. Almost 10,000 homes were levelled by the earthquake. A further 5 people were killed in powerful aftershocks which occurred on 26 February, 2003.
The 2003 Bam earthquake struck the Kerman province of southeastern Iran at 01:56 UTC (5:26 AM Iran Standard Time) on December 26. The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The earthquake was particularly destructive in Bam, with the death toll amounting to 26,271 people and injuring an additional 30,000. The effects of the earthquake were exacerbated by the use of mud brick as the standard construction medium; many of the area's structures did not comply with earthquake regulations set in 1989.Following the earthquake the U.S. offered direct humanitarian assistance to Iran and in return the state promised to comply with an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency which supports greater monitoring of its nuclear interests. In total a reported 44 countries sent in personnel to assist in relief operations and 60 countries offered assistance.Following the earthquake, the Iranian government seriously considered moving the capital of Tehran in fear of an earthquake occurring there. The earthquake had a psychological impact on many of the victims for years afterwards. A new institutional framework in Iran was established to address problems of urban planning and to reconstruct the city of Bam in compliance with strict seismic regulations. This process marked a turning point, as government ministers and international organizations collaborated under this framework with local engineers and local people to organize the systematic rebuilding of the city.
The 2003 Bingöl earthquake hit eastern Turkey with a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent) on 1 May at 03:27 local time. The epicenter of this strike-slip earthquake was in Bingöl Province, 15 km north of Bingöl. At least 177 people were killed, and 625 buildings collapsed or suffered heavy damage in the affected region. Eighty-four of the fatalities occurred when a dormitory block collapsed in a boarding school in Celtiksuyu.
The 2003 Boumerdès earthquake occurred on May 21 at 19:44:21 local time in northern Algeria. The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The epicentre of the earthquake was located near the town of Thénia in Boumerdès Province, approximately 60 km east of the capital Algiers. The quake was the strongest to hit Algeria in more than twenty years – since 1980, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake resulted in at least 2,633 deaths.
The 2003 Colima earthquake occurred on 21 January with a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The epicenter was located on the Pacific coast in the Mexican state of Colima. The earthquake was felt as far away as Mexico City and in southern parts of the United States.
The 2003 Hokkaidō earthquake, scientifically named the 2003 Tokachi-Oki earthquake (十勝沖地震, 2003 Tokachi-Oki Jishin), occurred off the coast of Hokkaidō, Japan on 26 September at 04:50 local time (19:50 UTC 25 September). At a focal depth of 27 km (17 mi), this great undersea earthquake measured 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale, making it the most powerful earthquake of 2003, as well as one of the most intense earthquakes to hit Japan since modern record-keeping began in 1900.The Hokkaido earthquake caused extensive damage, destroying roads all around Hokkaidō, and triggered power outages and extensive landslides. Over 800 people were injured. The earthquake also caused a tsunami reaching 4 meters in height. The earthquake's presence was felt throughout Japan, stretching all the way to Honshu and Tokyo.
The 2003 San Simeon earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.6 on the Central Coast of California, about 7 miles (11 km) northeast of San Simeon. It occurred at 11:15 PST (19:15 UTC) on December 22. The earthquake probably occurred on the Oceanic fault zone in the Santa Lucia Mountains. It was caused by thrust faulting and propagated southeast from the hypocenter for 12 miles (19 km). The most violent ground movement occurred within 50 miles of the epicenter, though the earthquake was felt as far away as Los Angeles. It was the most destructive earthquake to hit the U.S since the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake occurred at 00:58:53 UTC on 26 December with the epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The shock had a moment magnitude of 9.1–9.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The undersea megathrust earthquake was caused when the Indian Plate was subducted by the Burma Plate and triggered a series of devastating tsunamis along the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing 230,000 people in 14 countries, and inundating coastal communities with waves up to 30 metres (100 ft) high. It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history. Indonesia was the hardest-hit country, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand.It is the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on a seismograph and had the longest duration of faulting ever observed, between 8.3 and 10 minutes. It caused the entire planet to vibrate as much as 1 centimetre (0.4 inches) and triggered other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. Its epicentre was between Simeulue and mainland Indonesia. The plight of the affected people and countries prompted a worldwide humanitarian response. In all, the worldwide community donated more than US$14 billion (2004) in humanitarian aid. The event is known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake. The resulting tsunami was given various names, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, South Asian tsunami, Indonesian tsunami, the Christmas tsunami and the Boxing Day tsunami.
The 2004 Al Hoceima earthquake occurred on 24 February at 02:27:47 local time near the coast of northern Morocco. The strike-slip earthquake measured 6.3 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Between 628 and 631 people were killed, 926 were injured, and up to 15,000 people were made homeless in the Al Hoceima-Imzourene-Beni Abdallah area.
The Chūetsu earthquakes (中越地震, Chūetsu jishin) occurred in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, at 17:56 local time (08:56 UTC) on Saturday, October 23, 2004. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) named it the "Heisei 16 Niigata Prefecture Chuetsu Earthquake" (平成16年新潟県中越地震, Heisei ju-roku-nen Niigata-ken Chuetsu Jishin). Niigata Prefecture is located in the Hokuriku region of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. The initial earthquake had a magnitude of 6.6 and caused noticeable shaking across almost half of Honshu, including parts of the Tōhoku, Hokuriku, Chūbu, and Kantō regions.
The 2004 Nabire earthquake occurred on November 26 in Papua, Indonesia. The strike-slip event had a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Total deaths for the event amounted to 32, and the total number of injured (as reported by various agencies) was 130–213.
The 2005 Kashmir earthquake occurred at 08:50:39 Pakistan Standard Time on 8 October in the Pakistani territory of Azad Kashmir. It was centered near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The earthquake also affected countries in the surrounding region where tremors were felt in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Chinese Xinjiang. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust.
The Fukuoka earthquake struck Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan at 10:53 am JST on March 20, 2005, and lasted for approximately 1 minute. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) measured it as peaking at a magnitude of 7.0 (6.6) and named it and its subsequent aftershocks the Fukuoka Prefecture western offshore earthquakes (福岡県西方沖地震, Fukuoka-ken Seihō Oki Jishin). The quake occurred along a previously unknown fault in the Genkai Sea, North of Fukuoka city, and the residents of Genkai island were forced to evacuate as houses collapsed and landslides occurred in places. Investigations subsequent to the earthquake determined that the new fault was most likely an extension of the known Kego fault that runs through the centre of the city.Fukuoka is not as seismically active as many other parts of Japan, and was known prior to the earthquake as one of Japan's safest locations in terms of natural disasters; the previous earthquake, a magnitude 5, had occurred over a hundred years ago and it had been centuries since the city had experienced a serious earthquake.
The 2005 Hindu Kush earthquake hit northeastern Afghanistan with a magnitude of 6.5 on December 12 at 21:47 (UTC). According to the United States Geological Survey, the maximum Mercalli intensity was V (Moderate) at Charikar. Five people were killed in the Hindu Kush region and landslides blocked several roads near Bagh, Kashmir. The earthquake occurred some 65 miles away from Faizabad, a city in the Hindu Kush mountains, but it could be felt in many neighboring areas. It could even be felt about 200 miles away in Islamabad, Pakistan. The quake was strong enough to trigger panic among survivors of October's devastating earthquake, who came out from their makeshift shelters in freezing temperatures. Although magnitude-6 earthquakes typically cause severe damage, this quake caused relatively little due to the fact that it occurred deep underground (about 140 miles).
The 2005 Lake Tanganyika earthquake occurred at 14:19:56 local time on 5 December along the East African Rift. This event occurred on a normal fault and had a moment magnitude of 6.8. The fault break initiated at a depth of 22 kilometers (14 mi).Early reports indicated that the heaviest damage was sustained by the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a region already ravaged by extensive war and extreme poverty. The area houses tens of thousands of refugees displaced by conflicts, such as the Second Congo War and the Burundian Civil War, that have plagued the African Great Lakes in the 1990s and 2000s.Dozens of houses collapsed in the DRC city of Kalemie. Michel Bonnardeaux, a UN spokesman, said that most of the casualties were caused by falling zinc or steel roofs. The cost to rebuild the whole damage was 1.5 million dollars.Depending on several factors including soil types, prevalent construction techniques and the acceleration from the earthquake itself, earthquakes with magnitudes in the 6–7 range may or may not cause wide spread damage. In East Africa such seismic events can wreak havoc. The quake was centred roughly below Lake Tanganyika and – in addition to the DRC, where the most widespread damage has been reported – it was felt in Burundi, Tanzania, Rwanda, and as far away as the coastal city of Mombasa in Kenya.The tremor was felt in places as far as Luanda, Angola, where it was felt for around 20 seconds, enough to send people running in panic in search of a shelter. No damage was reported there.
The 2005 Miyagi earthquake struck the east coast of the Japanese island of Honshū at 11.46 am (02:46 UTC) on August 16, causing casualties, building collapses and power outages. The event registered 7.2 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 2005 northern Peru earthquake occurred on September 25 at 20:56 local time (01:56 UTC) with a magnitude of 7.5. It resulted in the deaths of at least five people.The epicenter was located about 100 km (62 mi) northeast of the jungle city of Moyobamba in the San Martín Region of Peru, and the earthquake struck an area about 715 km (444 mi) north of Lima. With its hypocenter located roughly 115 km (71 mi) below the surface, the quake extended itself below the Andes and was felt in a large area, including the Peruvian coastal regions and as far away as Bogotá, Colombia, as well as most of Ecuador and western Brazil.Four people had initially been reported dead by the Peruvian media, but the mayor of Lamas (near Tarapoto) confirmed that only one had died and eleven more were injured.  The media has reports of another fatal victim. Buildings damaged in Tarapoto, Moyobamba, Chachapoyas, Yurimaguas, Iquitos, Juanjuí, Bagua, Cajamarca, Tingo María and other cities.Power outages were reported in Bagua, Jaén, Tambogrande and Talara.
The 2005 Qeshm earthquake occurred on November 27 at 13:52 IRST (10:22 UTC) on the sparsely populated Qeshm Island off Southern Iran, killing 13 people and devastating 13 villages. It was Iran's second major earthquake of 2005, following that at Zarand in February. The epicenter was about 1,500 kilometers (930 mi) south of Tehran, close to Iran's southern borders. Initial measurements showed that the earthquake registered about 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale, although that was reduced to 5.8 after further analysis. More than 400 minor aftershocks followed the main quake, 36 of which were greater than magnitude 2.5. The earthquake occurred in a remote area during the middle of the day, limiting the number of fatalities. Iranian relief efforts were effective and largely adequate, leading the country to decline offers of support from other nations and UNICEF.Qeshm Island is part of the Simply Folded Belt, the most seismically active part of the Zagros fold and thrust belt. Similar to most earthquakes in the area, the 2005 event resulted from reverse slip faulting. Since it lies in such a seismically active area, there is a high risk of destructive earthquakes in Iran; 1 in 3,000 deaths are attributable to earthquakes. One geophysicist has cited the lack of strict building codes as a serious concern.
The 2005 Ruichang earthquake occurred at 8:49 am local time on 26 November in Ruichang, Jiangxi, China. Reports from different authorities of the earthquake's Richter magnitude ranged from 5.2 to 5.7. At least fourteen people died, including five in Ruichang, seven in neighboring Jiujiang, and two across the river in Wuxue, Hubei. At least 370 people were injured, including twenty seriously so. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed and thousands damaged. Residents temporarily fled homes, businesses, and even hospitals for fear of aftershocks. Local temperatures were mild at the time, around 10 °C. Shockwaves were felt as far away as Shangrao, Changsha, and Wuhan.
The 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake occurred on 28 March off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. At least 915 people were killed, mostly on the island of Nias. The event caused panic in the region, which had been devastated by the massive tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, but this earthquake generated a relatively small tsunami that caused limited damage. It was the third most powerful earthquake since 1965 in Indonesia.The earthquake occurred at 16:09:37 UTC (23:09:37 local time) on 28 March 2005. The hypocenter was located 30 kilometres (19 mi) below the surface of the Indian Ocean, where subduction is forcing the Indo-Australian Plate to the southwest under the Eurasian Plate's Sunda edge. The area is 200 kilometres (120 mi) west of Sibolga, Sumatra, or 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) northwest of Jakarta, approximately halfway between the islands of Nias and Simeulue. Seismic recordings give the earthquake a moment magnitude of about 8.6, and effects were felt as far away as Bangkok, Thailand, over 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) away.
The 2005 Tarapacá earthquake occurred on June 13 at 22:44:33 UTC (18:44:33 local time). Its epicenter was located near locality of Mamiña, affecting the Tarapacá and adjacent parts of Bolivia.
The 2005 Zarand earthquake affected several villages in the Kerman province of Iran on February 22 at 05:55:23 local time. The shock measured 6.4 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Zarand is located 740 km southeast of Tehran. The maximum recorded peak ground acceleration was 0.51 g at Shirinrud dam. The United States' National Earthquake Information Center and the Belgian' Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters both show that 612 died and 1,411 were injured in the event.
The 2006 Mozambique earthquake occurred at 22:19 UTC on 22 February. It had a magnitude of 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale and caused 4 deaths and 36 injuries. The epicenter was near Machaze in Manica Province of southern Mozambique, just north of the Save River. It was the largest historical earthquake in Mozambique and the first earthquake in southern Africa to have an identified surface rupture.
The 2006 Banda Sea earthquake occurred in the Banda Sea region, at 16:58 (UTC) on January 27, 2006, with a magnitude of 7.6Mw. The location was 200 km south of Ambon Island, and 445 km north east of Dili, East Timor. Other significant earthquakes occur regularly (2005, 2009 for example), however they are not identified readily due to the isolation of the occurrences, lack of damage to human communities, and dearth of reporting and research. The 2006 Banda Sea earthquake was felt as far away as Northern Australia.
The 2006 Borujerd earthquake occurred in the early morning of 31 March 2006 in the South of Borujerd with massive destruction in Borujerd, Silakhor and Dorood areas of the Loristan Province in Western Iran. The centre of the earthquake was in Darb-e Astaneh village south of the Borujerd City. The earthquake measured 6.1 on the Richter magnitude scale.
The 2006 Gulf of Mexico earthquake occurred in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 10 at 10:56 AM Eastern Daylight Time. The intraplate earthquake measured 5.8 on the moment magnitude scale and its epicenter was located about 250 miles west-southwest of Anna Maria, Florida. The event was felt throughout much of the Gulf Coast of the United States and was the second earthquake of magnitude 5 or greater in the Gulf during 2006. Felt intensities, as measured on the Mercalli intensity scale, were as high as IV (Light) in Florida, with parts of Georgia at III (Weak).
The 2006 Hawaii earthquake occurred on Sunday October 15 at 7:07:49 AM local time with a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was centered 21 kilometers (13 mi) southwest of Puakō and 21 km (13 mi) north of Kailua-Kona, Hawaiʻi, just offshore of the Kona Airport, at a depth of 29 km (18 mi). It produced several aftershocks, including one that measured a magnitude of 6.1 seven minutes after the main shock. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center measured a small, nondestructive tsunami of 4 in (100 mm) on the coast of the Big Island.
The 2006 Hengchun earthquakes occurred on December 26 at 20:26 and 20:34 local time off the southwest coast of Taiwan in the Luzon Strait, which connects the South China Sea with the Philippine Sea. The International Seismological Centre measured the shocks at 7.0 and 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale. The earthquakes not only caused casualties and building damage, but several submarine communications cables were cut, disrupting telecommunication services in various parts of Asia. Coincidentally, the earthquake occurred on the second anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake that devastated the coastal communities across Southeast and South Asia and 3rd anniversary of the 2003 earthquake that affected the southern Iranian city of Bam.
The 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake (also known as the Bantul earthquake) occurred at 05:54 local time on 27 May with a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum intensity of IX (Destructive) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The shock occurred on the southern coast of Java near the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, and caused a disproportionate number of casualties, with more than 5,700 deaths and 37,000 injuries, and financial losses of (Rp 29.1 Trillion ($3.1B)). The eruption of Mount Merapi, a stratovolcano that was entering a period of unrest, was originally thought to have a connection with the earthquake. With a lack of instruments in the area, the shock was initially attributed with the Opak Fault that lies to the east of the affected areas, but later InSAR analysis revealed that another previously unknown fracture was responsible for the sequence of shocks.
The 2006 Pangandaran earthquake and tsunami occurred on July 17 at 15:19 local time along a subduction zone off the coast of west and central Java, a large and densely populated island in the Indonesian archipelago. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.7 and a maximum perceived intensity of IV (Light) in Jakarta, the capital and largest city of Indonesia. There were no direct effects of the earthquake's shaking due to its light to moderate intensity, and the large loss of life from the event was due to the resulting tsunami, which inundated a 300 km (190 mi) portion of the Java coast that had been unaffected by the earlier 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that was off the coast of Sumatra. The July 2006 earthquake was also centered in the Indian Ocean, 180 kilometers (110 mi) from the coast of Java, and had a duration of more than three minutes.An abnormally slow rupture at the Sunda Trench and a tsunami that was unusually strong relative to the size of the earthquake were both factors that led to it being categorized as a tsunami earthquake. Several thousand kilometers to the southeast, surges of several meters were observed in northwestern Australia, but in Java the tsunami runups (height above normal sea level) were typically 5–7 meters (16–23 ft) and resulted in the deaths of more than 600 people. Other factors may have contributed to exceptionally high peak runups of 10–21 m (33–69 ft) on the small and mostly uninhabited island of Nusa Kambangan, just to the east of the resort town of Pangandaran, where damage was heavy and a large loss of life occurred. Since the shock was felt with only moderate intensity well inland, and even less so at the shore, the surge arrived with little or no warning. Other factors contributed to the tsunami being largely undetected until it was too late and, although a tsunami watch was posted by an American tsunami warning center and a Japanese meteorological center, no information was delivered to people at the coast.
The 2006 Kamchatka earthquakes began on April 21, 2006 at 12:25 PM local time with the occurrence of a very large reverse fault event. This shock had a moment magnitude of 7.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The hypocenter was located near the coast of Koryak Autonomous Okrug at an estimated depth of 22 km, as reported by the International Seismological Centre. This event caused damage in three villages and was followed by a number of large aftershocks. Several M6.6 earthquakes struck on April 29 at 16:58 UTC and again on May 22 at 11:12 UTC. These earthquakes caused no deaths; however, 40 people were reported injured.
The 2006 Kuril Islands earthquake occurred on November 15 at 8:14:16 pm JST with a moment magnitude of 8.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IV (Light). This megathrust earthquake was the largest event in the central Kuril Islands since 1915 and generated a small tsunami that affected the northern Japanese coast. The tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean and damaged the harbor at Crescent City, California. Post-tsunami surveys indicate that the local tsunami in the central Kuril Islands reached runup of 15 metres (49 ft) or more.
The 2006 Mendoza earthquake was a medium-intensity seismic movement in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. It took place at 11:03 AM (UTC-3) on 5 August 2006, and had a magnitude of 5.7 in the Richter scale. Its hypocenter was centered at 33°13′48″S 68°56′24″W, 35 km south-southeast of Mendoza, the provincial capital, exactly at the town of Ugarteche, Luján de Cuyo, and at a depth of 33 km.The earthquake was felt in the provinces of Mendoza (V–VI in the Mercalli intensity scale), San Juan, San Luis (IV Mercalli), La Rioja, and Córdoba (III Mercalli). It damaged about 600 buildings in the Greater Mendoza metropolitan area (mostly either precarious or old), as well as causing brief interruptions in the supply of electric power and mobile phone communications. Only a few wounded people were reported; there were no fatalities.On the following day a new, a minor earthquake (magnitude 3.7) was recorded about 5 km from the previous location, at a depth of 90 km. It was felt as grade II–III in the Mercalli scale in the city of Mendoza.The area is the most seismically active in Argentina. This seismic event was the largest in 20 years; the 1985 Mendoza earthquake (magnitude 6.0) caused 6 casualties and thousands of damaged houses and was centered at Godoy Cruz, just 4 km at south of Mendoza.
The 2006 Greece earthquake occurred on January 8 at 13:34:53 local time and was felt throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean basin. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong).Its epicentre was located just off the island of Kythira about 200 kilometres (120 mi) south of Athens.One person was injured and a number of buildings and roads in Kythira were heavily damaged as a result. Several older houses on the island completely collapsed while the central square of the village of Mitata partially fell into the valley as a result of a subsequent landslide. Few buildings were damaged on the mainland closest to the epicentre (Cape Malea). On the island of Crete, two people were slightly injured in their attempt to abandon their homes. Damage to 146 buildings was recorded in western Crete, including the old town hall of Chania, the third Venetian arsenal, nine schools and many of the houses in the old Venetian town center.Nevertheless, despite the magnitude and the duration of the tremor (buildings in Athens swayed for almost 40 seconds) no other significant injury or damage was reported in the country's strongest earthquake in decades. This was mainly because the quake had a focal depth of approximately 55 kilometres (34 mi). The tremor was felt as far away as in Bari on the Adriatic Sea, Naples and much of southern Italy, Malta, Cairo and even along the Lebanese, Syrian and Israeli shorelines. No tsunami was associated with this event.
On July 29, the 2006 Tajikistan earthquake hit the Khatlon region of Tajikistan. The earthquake doublet killed three people and injured 19.Poor water and sanitation posed an ongoing risk to health, as did malaria, given its prevalence in the region and the fact that some people sleep outdoors without mosquito nets. Damaged roofs made from asbestos posed additional risks to health.Following an initial assessment mission of the earthquake affected areas on 29 July by the Minister for Emergency Situations, a second joint mission followed on 1 August, led by the Deputy Prime Minister and including the UN Country Team, WHO and humanitarian partners. WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, immediately activated other UN and international agencies and NGOs in response to the disaster.To date, more than ten health partners, including NGOs, UN and International agencies have worked together to provide 50,000 water purification tablets, 86 tents and essential household items, mosquito nets, soap, buckets and high energy biscuits and to ensure basic drugs and WHO has donated 1 NEHKit to support local health authorities in ensuring essential medications are available for affected communities and forwarded drug donation guidelines.Funding has been received from ECHO since January 2006, in support of WHO's work to 'strengthen and enhance the coordination of humanitarian health programmes' in Tajikistan.
The 2006 Tonga earthquake occurred on 4 May at 04:26:35 local time with a moment magnitude of 8.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). One injury occurred and a non-destructive tsunami was observed.
The 2006 Yanjin earthquake was a magnitude 5.2  earthquake in Yanjin County, Yunnan, China. It occurred on July 22, 2006, at 01:10 UTC (09:10 local time). Seismologists have placed the epicentre at 27.992°N 104.215°E﻿ / 27.992; 104.215, and its hypocenter at a depth of 10.0 km (6.2 mi), 35 km (22 mi) WNW from Zhaotong.The earthquake toppled at least 1400 houses and sent large boulders tumbling down the hillsides onto residential areas in the mountainous southern regions of Yunnan. Chinese officials have been reported as saying that the tremor killed 16 and injured 60 people in Yanjin County, and killed a further three and injured 46 more in nearby Daguan County.Railroad services in the region were halted by the quake, as the quake damaged the local railroad tracks, forcing officials to shut down service between Neijiang, Sichuan and Kunming, Yunnan.
The 2007 Aysén Fjord earthquakes occurred in Aisén Fjord, Chile from January 22–April 22. The biggest occurred at 1:53 p.m. (local time) on April 21 and reached a felt intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. On the moment magnitude scale, the earthquake reached a gradation of 6.2. Ten people disappeared, according to ONEMI (Chile's National emergency office), but three bodies were found on April 22 by the Chilean Navy.
The 2007 Alum Rock earthquake occurred on October 30 at 8:04 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time in Alum Rock Park in San Jose, California. It measured 5.6 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). The event was then the largest in the San Francisco Bay Area since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, but was later surpassed by the 2014 South Napa earthquake. Ground shaking from the Alum Rock quake reached San Francisco and Oakland and other points further north. Sixty thousand felt reports existed far beyond Santa Rosa, as far north as Eugene, Oregon.
The 2007 Tocopilla earthquake occurred on November 14 at 12:40:50 local time. Its epicenter was located between the localities of Quillagua and Tocopilla, affecting the Tarapacá and the Antofagasta regions in northern Chile. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 7.7 and lasted about 3 minutes and 35 seconds. Seventeen aftershocks of magnitude greater than 5.3, including one of magnitude 7.1 and two others of magnitude 6.3 or higher, were recorded. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami warning, stating a tsunami had been generated; after one hour, this warning was cancelled. The earthquake was felt from Santiago, 1,245 km south from the epicenter, to La Paz, about 700 km north-northeast.
The Chūetsu Offshore earthquake (Japanese: 平成19 年（2007 年）新潟県中越沖地震) was a powerful magnitude 6.6 earthquake that occurred 10:13 local time (01:13 UTC) on July 16, 2007, in the northwest Niigata region of Japan. The earthquake, which occurred at a previously unknown offshore fault shook Niigata and neighbouring prefectures. The city of Kashiwazaki and the villages of Iizuna and Kariwa registered the highest seismic intensity of a strong 6 on Japan's shindo scale, and the quake was felt as far away as Tokyo. Eleven deaths and at least 1000 injuries were reported, and 342 buildings were completely destroyed, mostly older wooden structures. Prime Minister Shinzō Abe broke off from his election campaign in Southern Japan to visit Kashiwazaki and promised to "make every effort towards rescue and also to restore services such as gas and electricity".
The 2007 Gisborne earthquake occurred under the Pacific Ocean about 50 kilometres (31 mi) off the eastern coast of New Zealand's North Island at 8:55 pm NZDT on 20 December. The tremor had a Richter magnitude of 6.7 and maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), and affected the city of Gisborne, but was felt widely across the country from Auckland in the north to Dunedin in the south.
The 2007 Guatemala earthquake occurred on June 13 at 13:29:46 local time. The epicenter was located in the Pacific Ocean, south of Puerto Quetzal, about 115 kilometres (71 mi) south-southwest of Guatemala City.The quake was reportedly felt in Guatemala, El Salvador and parts of Mexico. The quake caused a minor landslide on the Inter-American Highway, and a small number of houses were reported to have been damaged or destroyed along Guatemala's south coast, but there were no reports of major damages or casualties.While the USGS assigned a magnitude of 6.7 for this event, many local seismological agencies in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua only registered the quake in the 5.5–6.0 range. These calculations are more accurate due to the seismographs' locations closer to the epicenter, and are in agreement with the minor shaking reported by residents.In addition, the USGS coins all movements as earthquakes, while in Latin America, small movements such as this one are called tremors ("temblores" in Spanish).
The 2007 Iberian Peninsula earthquake (also known as the 2007 Horseshoe earthquake) occurred at 10:35:31 Greenwich Mean Time on February 12 with its epicentre in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, off the coasts of Portugal and Morocco. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum intensity of IV (Largely observed) on the European macroseismic scale. The shock occurred at a plate boundary where a number of large, very large, and great earthquakes are known to have taken place as far back as the eighteenth-century. The event was captured by a network of strong motion instruments in Spain, but due to the distance at which the shock was recorded, the peak ground acceleration was very low.
The 2007 Kent earthquake registered 4.3 on the Richter scale and struck south east Kent, South East England on 28 April 2007 at 07:18:12 UTC (08:18:12 local time), at a shallow depth of 5.3 km.The worst affected area was the town of Folkestone, although the towns of Deal, Dover and Ashford were also affected. The tremors could be felt across much of Kent and south east England, including as far as East Sussex, Essex and Suffolk, as well as on the other side of the English Channel at Calais and Brussels.
The 2007 Kuril Islands earthquake occurred east of the Kuril Islands on 13 January at 1:23 p.m. Japan Standard Time. The shock had a moment magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). A non-destructive tsunami was generated, with maximum wave amplitudes of .32 meters (1 ft 1 in). The earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting and was located 95 km to the south east of the 8.3 magnitude 2006 Kuril Islands earthquake which had occurred the previous November.
The October 2007 Mariana Islands earthquake occurred on October 31 at 13:30 local time (03:30 UTC) in the Pagan region of the Mariana Islands. The magnitude of this earthquake is Mw 7.2. The epicenter was 410 km from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands and 605 km from Hagåtña, Guam. Intensity of MM IV was recorded in Saipan and part of Guam.The earthquake was in the region where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the Mariana Plate. Although the broad-scale tectonics of this region are dominated by the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, the Pacific Plate does not reach the Philippine Sea Plate in this region, as the Mariana Plate is located in between. The Pacific Plate thrusts under the Mariana Plate at the Mariana Trench, and the Mariana Plate is separated from the Philippine Sea Plate by a spreading ridge, the Mariana Trough.
The 2007 Martinique earthquake took place on November 29 at 15:00:19 local time in the Windward Islands region, underneath the Martinique Passage. It was a magnitude 7.4 earthquake which occurred from Fort-de-France, Martinique.This earthquake was felt strongly in Martinique, Dominica, St. Lucia, Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua, St Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Power outages were reported in Martinique, Dominica and Guadeloupe. It was also felt in other Eastern Caribbean islands, from Puerto Rico to the north to Trinidad and Tobago to the south. It could also be felt in part of South America such as in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. In Caracas, Venezuela, some people evacuated office buildings. The intensity reached VI to VII on the EMS98 scale in Martinique and Dominica.In the surrounding region, the South American Plate is subducting beneath the Caribbean Plate. This earthquake occurred within the South America Plate and was in response to stresses generated by the slow distortion of the plate.
The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquakes were a series of small volcanic earthquakes measuring less than 4.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. They took place in the sparsely populated Nazko area of the Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of Nazko Cone, a small tree-covered cinder cone that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.No damage or casualties resulted from the Nazko earthquakes, which were too small to be felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them. The earthquake swarm occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the Central Coast to the Central Interior of British Columbia.
At 9:41:58 a.m. on March 25, 2007, the Noto Peninsula earthquake (能登半島地震, Noto hantō jishin), a magnitude 6.9 earthquake, struck the Hokuriku region of Japan, near the Noto Peninsula. The earthquake shook the city of Wajima, the city of Nanao, and the town of Anamizu with a seismic intensity of 6+ on Japan's shindo scale. One death, in the city of Wajima, and at least 356 injuries have been reported.
The 2007 Peru earthquake, which measured 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale, hit the central coast of Peru on August 15 at 23:40:57 UTC (18:40:57 local time) and lasted for about three minutes. The epicenter was located 150 km (93 mi) south-southeast of Lima at a depth of 39 km (24 mi). The United States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center reported that it was a Very strong earthquake. The Peruvian government stated that 519 people were killed by the quake.
The 2007 Solomon Islands earthquake took place on 2 April 2007, near the provincial capital of Gizo on Ghizo Island, in Solomon Islands. Its magnitude was calculated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as being at 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale. The tsunami that followed the earthquake killed 52 people. According to the USGS, the earthquake was recorded around 7:39:56 a.m. local time (UTC+11). The focus was 10 km (6 mi) deep and 40 km (25 mi) South South-East of Gizo township on New Georgia Islands in Western Province. There were numerous aftershocks, the largest of which had a magnitude of 6.2.
The March 2007 Sumatra earthquakes occurred near the northern end of Lake Singkarak in Sumatra, Indonesia, on March 6. The first shock in this earthquake doublet struck with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe) and the second shock that arrived two hours later had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong).
The September 2007 Sumatra earthquakes were a series of megathrust earthquakes that struck the Sunda Trench off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, three greater than magnitude 7. A series of tsunami bulletins was issued for the area. The most powerful of the series had a magnitude of 8.5, which makes it in the top 20 of the largest earthquakes ever recorded on a seismograph.
Earthquakes in 2008 resulted in about 88,011 fatalities. The 2008 Sichuan earthquake was the deadliest with 87,587 fatalities, and also the largest at 7.9 on the moment magnitude scale. Other significant earthquakes struck Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, Japan, Colombia, and other parts of China.
The 2008 Qeshm earthquake occurred at 14:30 IRST (11:00 UTC) on 10 September. It had an epicenter on the island of Qeshm, close to the location of the 2005 Qeshm earthquake. It had a magnitude of 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale and caused seven deaths and 30 injuries. It was followed by five aftershocks of M 5.0 or greater over the next ten months.
The Reno earthquakes of 2008, also known as the "Mogul-Somersett earthquake sequence", occurred in or near the western Reno, Nevada suburbs of Mogul and Somersett. The earthquake swarm began in February 2008, but the first significant quake of the series occurred on April 15, 2008, registering a 3.6 magnitude. On April 24, 2008, two quakes in the same area registered 4.1 and 4.2. On April 25, 2008, the quake of largest magnitude occurred, registering 4.7 on the Richter scale and causing damage in the immediate area around the epicenter, including destroying 200 feet of a wooden flume supplying water from the Highland Ditch, also known as the Highland Ditch flume. The flume carried up to 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) a day from the Highland Ditch to Reno's Chalk Bluff Water Treatment Facility and another 5 million US gallons (19,000 m3) to area irrigation users.In addition to these significant quakes, hundreds of smaller events have also occurred in the same area. This swarm is significant because no known dominant fault line has been responsible for the earthquake swarm occurring in the region. It is also highly unusual because the quakes have, for the most part, been limited to a three-mile area. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that over 620 earthquakes have occurred in the general three mile vicinity since the swarm has been monitored. Seismologists with the USGS as well as the Nevada Seismological Laboratory expressed concern that the increasing magnitude of the felt quakes may indicate that a larger earthquake was imminent. As yet, they have not identified the particular tectonics involved with these earthquakes. However, they have stated categorically that volcanic activity is not involved. The last strong earthquake (M6.1) in the Reno area in occurred on April 24, 1914 and the state's most powerful quake to date was the M7.4 1915 Pleasant Valley earthquake south of Winnemucca.
The 2008 Skåne County earthquake occurred at 06.20am CET (05.20 UTC) on 16 December and affected the southern part of Sweden and eastern parts of Denmark. The epicenter was 5 km southwest of Sjöbo and 60 km east of Malmö. The earthquake was considered "moderately strong" with a moment magnitude calculated at 4.2–4.3 . Strong shaking was reported widely in Sweden from Skåne to Östergötland, in Denmark, and in northern Poland. The Skåne region is known for extremely low seismic activity, with only three small earthquakes (each less than 2.8) detected between 1970 and 2008, and only 14 earthquakes since 1375. Roadways in Sweden and Denmark were reported with cracks but investigations did not determine if any were caused by the earthquake.
The 2008 Bandar Abbas earthquake occurred on 10 September in the Hormozgān Province of southern Iran, 850 kilometres (528 mi) south of Tehran. Its epicenter was near the port city of Bandar Abbas, where an earthquake two years prior had caused damage. The earthquake measured 6.1 on the moment magnitude scale and 6 on the surface wave scale, killing seven people and injuring up to 47. Causing both catastrophic and minor damage, the earthquake devastated up to 200 villages throughout southern Iran, but left the port city of Bandar Abbas almost unscathed. Citizens reportedly panicked when the earthquake hit, emptying into the parks of the city and other open areas.
The 2008 Chechnya earthquake was a 5.8 Mw earthquake that occurred on October 11, 2008 at 09:06:10 UTC in Chechnya, Russia, and lasted for 40 seconds. At least 13 people from the districts of Gudermes, Shalinsky and Kurchaloyevsky were killed by the quake and a series of aftershocks, which were felt throughout the North Caucasus, and even in Armenia and Georgia. In addition, about 116 people were injured.Dagestan, Ingushetia, North Ossetia and Stavropol also experienced the tremors, with a total of 16 shocks between 3 and 6 on the Richter scale. Some tremors lasted up to 30 seconds, causing serious structural damage in two Chechen districts, and left 52,000 people without power in three districts. Communications and roads in Chechnya were also disrupted.500 families in the heavily affected town of Kurchaloy needed tent shelters, and the local hospital in that town was evacuated. There was only minimal damage in the Chechnya capital of Grozny, consisting mostly of broken windows.Ramzan Kadyrov, the President of Chechnya said, "We have received information on damage from various districts... each and every [victim] will receive the necessary help and support."A strong magnitude 5.3 aftershock struck the region approximately 16 minutes after the initial quake.
The 2008 Chino Hills earthquake occurred at 11:42:15 a.m. PDT on July 29 in Southern California. The epicenter of the magnitude 5.5 earthquake was in Chino Hills, approximately 28 miles (45 km) east-southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Though no lives were lost, eight people were injured, and it caused considerable damage in numerous structures throughout the area and caused some amusement park facilities to shut down their rides. The earthquake led to increased discussion regarding the possibility of a stronger earthquake in the future.
The 2008 Damxung earthquake hit Damxung County, Xizang (Tibet), west of Lhasa, in the People's Republic of China around 16:30 China Standard Time on October 6, 2008.

The 2008 Dodecanese earthquake occurred near Kattavia on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea on 15 July. The quake struck at 06:26 a.m. local time (GMT+3) and one woman was killed when she slipped and fell as she tried to flee her home. However, the earthquake did not cause any major damage. The earthquake was felt across the entire eastern Mediterranean, as far west as Libya, and inland as far as Damascus.There was a significant aftershock the next day, 16 July, at 02:52 a.m. local time, which resulted in additional injuries. The aftershock was rated between 4.8 Mw and 5.0 Mw.There is not unanimity on the location of the epicenter. The USGS places the epicenter at 35.983°N 27.785°E﻿ / 35.983; 27.785 which is under the island of Rhodes about 3.4 kilometers northeast of Kattavia; while the Athens Institute of Geodynamics coordinates (35.85°N 27.92°E﻿ / 35.85; 27.92) place the epicenter 19 km southeast of Kattavia which is off the island, under the seabed.
The 2008 El Calvario earthquake occurred in central Colombia on 24 May and measured 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale. The earthquake occurred at 2:20:46 p.m. (19:20:46 UTC) at the epicenter (El Calvario, Meta). The depth was 35 km; it was superficial according to an Ingeominas report. The epicenter was located 35 km from Villavicencio and 50 km from Bogotá. There were 11 confirmed fatalities and 4,181 injured, mostly in the towns of Puente Quetame, Fosca, Fomeque and Guayabetal in Cundinamarca, and in El Calvario, Meta.A M4 foreshock occurred at 12:08 local time (17:08 GMT) near San Juanito, in the Meta Central Department, at a depth of 30 km.The town of Puente Quetame, Cundinamarca was the most affected. Several houses collapsed in this small town of 6,500 inhabitants. The reconstruction of the affected structures cost 10 million USD (exchange rate COP 2000). In Bogotá, a partial collapse of the building of "Lotería de Bogotá" was reported, with no major consequences. The emergency network in the Capital District was put on maximum alert. A collapse of fixed phone lines and cell phones occurred, due to the great number of people calling to find out about their relatives. The quake was also felt in cities as far away as Medellín and Bucaramanga.In Guayabetal, Meta, civil defense workers could only reach the town from Villavicencio using motorcycles, because fallen buildings blocked cars from passing. The workers found two people dead and another 26 people trapped in a bus. Now there is a bypass to that point coming from Villavicencio, because 2 km of Highway 48 was closed due to fallen debris.
The 2008 Iceland earthquake was a doublet earthquake that struck on May 29 at 15:46 UTC in southwestern Iceland. The recorded magnitudes of the two main quakes were 5.9 Mw and 5.8 Mw, respectively, giving a composite magnitude of 6.1Mw. There were no human fatalities, but 30 injuries were reported and a number of sheep were killed. The epicenter of the earthquake was between the towns of Hveragerði and Selfoss, about 45 kilometers (28 mi) east-southeast of the capital, Reykjavík. It was the strongest earthquake to hit Iceland since the summer of 2000.
The 2008 Illinois earthquake was one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded in the state of Illinois, measuring a magnitude of 5.4. It occurred at 4:37:00am CDT (9:37:00 UTC) on April 18 within the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone at a depth of 11.6 km. It was centered near West Salem, Illinois and Mount Carmel, Illinois (the affected area is west of Terre Haute, Indiana and Vincennes, Indiana; east of St. Louis, Missouri; and northwest of Evansville, Indiana), specifically 38.450°N, 87.890°W, and felt as far as 450 miles (724 km) away. Tremors were felt as far west as Nebraska and Kansas City, as far south as Atlanta, as far east as Kitchener, Ontario and West Virginia, and as far north as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The earthquake was felt so far away, compared to earthquakes in other regions, because the old, rigid bedrock beneath much of the Midwest allows the tremor to propagate further.The earthquake epicenter was located in the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone, which is adjacent to the more famous New Madrid Seismic Zone.
On June 14, the 2008 Iwate earthquakestruck the Tōhoku region of northeastern Honshū in Japan. Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) officially named this earthquake the Iwate–Miyagi Nairiku earthquake in 2008 (平成20年（2008年）岩手・宮城内陸地震).This earthquake occurred in the south of the inland of Iwate Prefecture at 8:43 JST on June 14 (23:43 UTC on June 13). The JMA magnitude was estimated at Mj 7.2, and the moment magnitude by USGS was at Mw 6.9. The epicenter was located at 39°01.7′N 140°52.8′E, about 85 kilometres (55 mi) north of Sendai and about 385 kilometres (240 mi) north-northeast of Tokyo.The strongest shaking was measured in the cities of Ōshū (Iwate) and Kurihara (Miyagi), both of which were measured as "strong 6" on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, shindo (震度, shindo). Peak ground acceleration readings were high, with a maximum vector sum (3 component) value of 4278 cm/s2 (4.36g).
The 2008 Kyrgyzstan earthquake struck on October 5 at 21:52 local time (15:52 UTC) with a moment magnitude of 6.6, killing 75 people, including 41 children, and injuring 150 people, including 93 children. The center of the earthquake was near the town of Nura, which was destroyed in the quake. The shock destroyed 100 buildings in the area and destroyed the nearby village of Kura. Minor damage also occurred in nearby Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The quake was felt throughout Central Asia. A magnitude 5.7 aftershock in Xinjiang and a magnitude 5.1 aftershock in Kyrgyzstan followed the earthquake. Two more aftershocks above magnitude 5 in Kyrgyzstan and one in Xinjiang struck on October 13, UTC time. Victims were transported in military helicopters to hospitals in Osh.The Kyrgyzstan Emergency Ministry said that few buildings remained standing in the village: "Almost all buildings in the village have been destroyed. The only buildings remaining are the properly engineered ones which were built recently: the school and a medical clinic." Kanatbek Abdrakhmatov, head of the Institute of Seismology, attributed much of the destruction due to inferior construction of the buildings, many of which were built out of clay and straw.The injured were paid 5,000 Kyrgyzstani soms (US$ 136) and 3 tons of coal, and families of the dead received 50 kg of flour. 200 people wish to remain in Nura, and were provided with 100 6-person tents. 100 mobile homes are being transported to Nura, and the village will be rebuilt in the spring of 2009, and should be completed by August 2009. Uzbekistan pledged the equivalent of US$200,000 in humanitarian aid, including 120 tons of cement, as well as other building materials.In Kyrgyzstan, an official day of mourning was observed on October 7, 2008.

A government representative told AP News that the quakes killed 22 people, wounded 20 and destroyed 100 homes.
The 2009 Andaman Islands earthquake occurred on August 11 at 19:55 UTC in the Andaman Islands of India. The earthquake magnitude was recorded as 7.5 Mw, and was the strongest in the region since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The epicentre was 260 km north of Port Blair, and tremors were felt in south-east India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami watch to India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand, but it was later lifted. No casualties or injuries were reported, although there were complaints about minor damage to buildings. At about the same time, the 2009 Shizuoka earthquake affected south Honshū in Japan.
The 2009 Bhutan earthquake occurred at 14:53 local time on September 21 in the eastern region of Bhutan with moment magnitude of 6.1. The epicenter was situated at 180 kilometres (110 mi) east of the capital Thimphu, in Mongar District. However, Bangladesh and northern India also felt it, with buildings in Guwahati, Assam, cracking up. The tremors were felt as far as Tibet.At least eleven people are reported to have been killed—seven in Bhutan, four in India. The death toll, initially ten, increased when one more died in the night. At least fifteen were wounded. Many of the deaths in Bhutan came about when their houses fell in on top of them. The Indians were construction workers whose road fell through.One businessman said the earthquake happened as shopping was underway for the Blessed Rainy Day ceremony of Buddhism. Another inhabitant said it "made the surrounding hills look like they were throwing up dust" and that "the road was suddenly filled with boulders and mud". Thousands are living outdoors as a result. Children were crushed under structures as they caved in. Roads were blocked but these were cleaned up relatively quickly. Monasteries were also struck. People ran for their lives out of their homes.
The 2009 Costa Rica earthquake (also known as Cinchona earthquake) occurred at 1:21:35 pm local time on January 8 with a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock took place in northern Costa Rica, 30 kilometres (19 mi) north-northwest of San José and was felt throughout Costa Rica and in southern central Nicaragua.
The 2009 Crete earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.4 on 1 July off the southern coast of the Island of Crete, Greece, at 12:30:09 local time. The shock was felt as far away as Cairo, Egypt, although it was not felt in Athens. The quake was felt quite sharply in Lasithi prefecture, and throughout the Heraklion Prefecture. There were a number of smaller earthquakes in the region in the three days preceding the quake, and there was a very small tsunami on the south coast of Crete on the day preceding the quake.The quake occurred along the plate boundary where the African Plate is pushing north and under the Aegean Sea Plate, causing the Hellenic Trench and subduction zone.
Beginning in 2009, the frequency of earthquakes in the U.S. State of Oklahoma rapidly increased from an average of less than two 3.0+ Mw earthquakes per year to hundreds in 2014 and 2015. Thousands of earthquakes have occurred in Oklahoma and surrounding areas in southern Kansas and North Texas since 2009. Scientific studies attribute the rise in earthquakes to the disposal of salt water produced during oil extraction that has been injected more deeply into the ground.One of the most significant earthquakes of this swarm was a 5.6 magnitude earthquake east of the Oklahoma City area which was the strongest earthquake in the history of Oklahoma. Multiple seismologists advised local residents of an even greater risk of earthquakes in 2014 when the number of earthquakes increased to a dangerously high level. In response to the major increase in earthquakes in the Central United States, the United States Geological Survey began developing a new seismic hazard model to account for risk associated with induced seismicity. To date, no fewer than six individual earthquake sequences in Oklahoma have been identified and named by the Oklahoma Geological Survey. Other swarms have been observed in south-central Kansas and North Texas.According to data from the United States Geological Survey, there have been approximately 2,068 earthquakes in Oklahoma with moment magnitudes greater than or equal to 3.0, about 65 earthquakes with magnitudes greater than or equal to 4.0, and two earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5.0 associated with the earthquake swarms from the beginning of 2009 through May 29, 2016.In March 2013, a peer-reviewed paper published by a research team led by seismologist Katie Keranen at the University of Oklahoma in the scientific journal Geology reported that "the volume of fluid injected into the subsurface related to the production of unconventional resources continues to rise" and that there was a link between the "zone of injection and the seismicity" potentially triggering the November 5, 2011 Prague earthquake. In March 28, 2016 the USGS released the USGS National Seismic Hazard Map which concluded that the primary cause of the earthquake in Oklahoma in 2011 was pressure on fault lines from cumulative effects of injecting oil drilling wastewater under high pressure into the underground. Although the 2011 earthquake was the largest on record, the USGS reported that the central and eastern U.S. (CEUS) has undergone the most dramatic increase in seismic activity in the United States since 2009 with an average of 318 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 a year up from 24 a year from 1973 to 2008. In 2015 there were 1,010 earthquakes in the CEUS region. By mid-March, 2016 there were already 226 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 and larger in the CEUS. The oil industry pressured the OGS to release a statement saying "The interpretation that best fits current data is that the Prague earthquake sequence was the result of natural causes" which they later recanted.
The 2009 Fiordland earthquake struck the South Island of New Zealand with a magnitude of 7.8  at 9:22 pm (NZST) on 15 July. The earthquake was centred in the remote region of Fiordland, with the epicentre located 150 km (93 mi) west-north-west of Invercargill near Dusky Sound in Fiordland National Park, at a depth of 12 km (7.5 mi). It is the largest New Zealand earthquake since the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake, which also had a magnitude of 7.8.
The 2009 Guerrero earthquake struck southeast of Chilpancingo, Guerrero with a moment magnitude of 5.8 Mexico on 27 April. The earthquake was at a depth of 30 miles and was felt in other parts of the country's central region, including Mexico City and the states of Hidalgo, Morelos, Puebla and Veracruz. Two women died of heart attacks in the municipality of Acapulco, Guerrero, where four homes also collapsed.
A 6.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in the Gulf of California, between the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California, on August 3, 2009, at 10:59:56 a.m. PDT (17:59:56 UTC). The quake's epicenter was located offshore, in the Gulf of California, between two islands, only 22 km (14 mi) from Isla Ángel de la Guarda and 36 km (22 mi) from Tiburón Island. It was 89 km (55 mi) north-northeast of Santa Isabel, Baja California, 185 km (115 mi) west of Hermosillo, Sonora. The earthquake occurred along the Tiburón fault zone that is part of the tectonic boundary between the North American plate and the Pacific plate.The quake rocked buildings in Puerto Libertad, El Desemboque, Punta Chueca, Bahía de Kino, Puerto Peñasco and Hermosillo. It was felt in Ensenada, Tecate, Mexicali and Tijuana. In the United States, the earthquake was felt in parts of Southern California and Arizona.
The 2009 Honduras earthquake occurred on May 28 at 02:24:45 AM local time with a moment magnitude of 7.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The epicenter was located in the Caribbean Sea, 64 kilometres (40 mi) northeast of the island of Roatán, 19 miles northeast of Port Royal, Isla de Bahias, 15 miles northwest of Isla Barbaretta, and 130 kilometres (81 mi) north-northeast of La Ceiba.

The 2009 Hualien earthquake occurred on December 19 at 21:02:16 (local time) with a moment magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). The oblique-slip event took place off the coast of Hualian, Taiwan. Strong shaking could be felt in Hualian City (Shindo 5 according to Central Weather Bureau) and Taipei (Shindo 4 according to Central Weather Bureau). The earthquake could also be felt in Hong Kong and Xiamen, China, and on several islands between Yonaguni and Tarama, Japan.
The 2009 Izu Islands earthquake (2009年東海道南方沖の地震) occurred on August 9, 2009 at 19:55 local time (10:55 UTC) near the Izu Islands, off the south coast of Honshu, Japan. The epicenter was 170 km from Hamamatsu and 325 km from Tokyo.This was an intraplate earthquake within the Pacific Plate, which is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate at the Izu-Bonin trench in this region. In Tokyo, the intensity reached shindo 4 (MM IV according to USGS). There was a region of abnormal seismic intensity along the Pacific coast close to the Japan Trench, in which the seismic intensity was greater than that observed in the region closer to the epicenter. Due to its depth of 297 km, this earthquake did not cause any damage.
The 2009 Karonga earthquakes occurred near Karonga, Malawi in December 2009 near the northern tip of Lake Malawi in southeast Africa.
The 2009 L'Aquila earthquake occurred in the region of Abruzzo, in central Italy. The main shock occurred at 03:32 CEST (01:32 UTC) on 6 April 2009, and was rated 5.8 or 5.9 on the Richter magnitude scale and 6.3 on the moment magnitude scale; its epicentre was near L'Aquila, the capital of Abruzzo, which together with surrounding villages suffered most damage. There have been several thousand foreshocks and aftershocks since December 2008, more than thirty of which had a Richter magnitude greater than 3.5.The earthquake was felt throughout central Italy; 308 people are known to have died, making this the deadliest earthquake to hit Italy since the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. In a subsequent inquiry of the handling of the disaster, seven members of the Italian National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Major Risks were accused of giving "inexact, incomplete and contradictory" information about the danger of the tremors prior to the main quake. On 22 October 2012, six scientists and one ex-government official were convicted of multiple manslaughter for downplaying the likelihood of a major earthquake six days before it took place. They were each sentenced to six years' imprisonment. On 10 November 2014, the scientists convicted of manslaughter for failing to predict the deadly earthquake have had the verdict overturned. Criticism was also applied to poor building standards that led to the failure of many modern buildings in a known earthquake zone: an official at Italy's Civil Protection Agency, Franco Barberi, said that "in California, an earthquake like this one would not have killed a single person".
A 6.2 magnitude earthquake occurred in Afghanistan on October 22, 2009 at 19:51:27 UTC. This was a relatively deep shock with a reverse focal mechanism. The maximum Mercalli intensity was V (Moderate) at Fayzabad, Badakhshan. Landslides killed three people and two others suffered fatal heart attacks.
The 2009 Papua earthquakes occurred on January 4 local time in Indonesia's West Papua province. The very large earthquake doublet comprised a magnitude 7.6 initial shock that had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong) and a second very large event that had a moment magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The events took place less than three hours apart to the east-northeast of Sorong on the Bird's Head Peninsula and left at least four people dead and dozens injured.An official of World Vision International, a humanitarian aid organization, said ten buildings had been totally destroyed, including several hotels and the house of a government official. Officials said three people, who had been staying at the Mutiara hotel in the city of Manokwari, were pulled alive from the rubble and taken to a hospital. Two hotels collapsed in the quake. There have been twenty-three aftershocks above magnitude 5.0 and another at magnitude 6.0. The earthquakes were also felt in nearby Papua New Guinea and Darwin, Australia.
The 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami took place on 29 September in the southern Pacific Ocean adjacent to the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone. The submarine earthquake occurred in an extensional environment and had a moment magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). It was the largest earthquake of 2009.A tsunami was generated which caused substantial damage and loss of life in Samoa, American Samoa, and Tonga. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center recorded a 3-inch (76 mm) rise in sea levels near the epicenter, and New Zealand scientists determined that the waves measured 14 metres (46 ft) at their highest on the Samoan coast. The quake occurred on the outer rise of the Kermadec-Tonga subduction zone. This is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates in the Earth's lithosphere meet and earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.Countries affected by the tsunami in the areas that were hit are American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga (Niuatoputapu) where more than 189 people were killed, especially children, most of them in Samoa. Large waves with no major damage were reported on the coasts of Fiji, the northern coast of New Zealand and Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. People took precautions in the low-lying atolls of Tokelau and moved to higher ground. Niue was reported as reasonably safe because it is high. There were no reports of high waves from Vanuatu, Kiribati, New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands.
The 2009 Shizuoka earthquake occurred with a magnitude of 6.4  that hit Shizuoka Prefecture in the south of Honshū, Japan, on August 11 at 05:07 local time (August 10, 20:07 UTC).

In addition, around 135,000 houses were severely damaged, 65,000 houses were moderately damaged and 79,000 houses were slightly damaged. An estimated 250,000 families (1,250,000 people) have been affected by the earthquake through the total or partial loss of their homes and livelihoods.
The 2009 Sumatra earthquake occurred with a magnitude of 6.7  on August 16, 2009 near Siberut, Mentawai Islands, Indonesia at 14:38 (local time), (07:38 UTC) injuring at least seven people. The earthquake was felt strongly in Padang. The epicentre of the quake was located 43 kilometres (27 mi) southeast of Siberut Island off western Sumatra.
The 2009 Talaud Islands earthquake occurred on February 12 at 01:34 local time (February 11, 2009 at 17:34 UTC) near Talaud Islands (Indonesian: Kepulauan Talaud), Indonesia. This reverse-type shock had a moment magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). There were at least 64 people injured and 597 buildings damaged in Talaud Islands. This earthquake could also be felt in the Philippines.
The 2009 Tonga earthquake occurred on March 19 at 18:17:41 UTC with a moment magnitude of 7.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The event occurred several hundred kilometers to the southeast of Nuku'alofa (the capital of Tonga), and was felt 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) distant on New Zealand's North Island, but there were no injuries or significant damage. A tsunami warning was issued but was later cancelled.The earthquake occurred four days after the beginning of a major undersea volcanic eruption near Hunga Tonga. There has been no confirmation yet of a direct link between the volcanic eruption and earthquake, but Ken Hudnut, a geophysicist for the United States Geological Survey, stated that "it seems suggestive at this point". Keleti Mafi, the Tongan government's chief seismologist, has suggested that the earthquake is likely to have a direct impact on the volcanic eruption, stating that the "strength of the earthquake could crack the volcano's (undersea) vent and allow more magma to be ejected".
The 2009 Vanuatu earthquakes were a series of large submarine earthquakes that took place to the west of the Torres Islands of Vanuatu on October 7, 2009 UTC. A 7.6 Mw earthquake, at 22:03 UTC, was followed by a 7.8 Mw event 15 minutes later at 22:18 UTC, and a 7.3 Mw event at 23:13 UTC. The similar size and close timing of the first two events has been dubbed as an earthquake doublet.

The 2010 Damghan earthquake (also known as the Kuh-Zar earthquake) occurred in northern Iran at 11:53:49 local time on August 27 with a moment magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). This strike-slip event damaged and destroyed a number of small villages in a sparsely populated region near the Alborz mountain range. It left four people dead, forty injured, and about 800 people without homes. The deaths and injuries in this moderate event were attributed to the low quality construction styles that are typical of the area. The Iranian Strong Motion Network provided data by which seismologists determined the type and extent of the slip as well as the peak ground acceleration. Other large and destructive earthquakes have affected the Semnan Province, including several destructive events in 856 AD and 1953.
The 2010 Indiana earthquake registered 3.8 on the moment magnitude scale and struck near Greentown and Kokomo on December 30, 2010 at 12:55:21 UTC at a depth of 3 mi. The quake occurred approximately 50 miles north of Indiana's capital, Indianapolis. It joins only three other earthquakes that have affected the northern Indiana area since 1999. The “extremely rare and unprecedented” earthquake had the largest magnitude of a northern Indiana earthquake in 175 years. Despite being considered a rare occurrence, the affected region of northern Indiana lies near many fault lines including the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone and the New Madrid Seismic Zone. Both zones are hotspots for tectonic activity, with the Wabash Valley Fault Zone reaching earthquake depths up to 18 km (11.4 mi.) deep. It was incorrectly recorded by nearby stations as a 4.2 magnitude before being downgraded to 3.8. No significant damages were reported from the incident, but the quake was felt by thousands, spanning across multiple cities and states. Towns as far away as Kalamazoo, Michigan and states as far as Wisconsin and Kentucky reported the earthquake.
The 2010 Beni-Ilmane earthquakes began 14 May at 12:29:22 UTC, when a M5.3 strike-slip earthquake occurred in Northern Algeria. With a maximum EMS-98 intensity of VII (Damaging), it was the first in a sequence of three shocks that affected the Bouïra Province over a ten-day period. Two people were killed, forty-three were injured, and some structural damage was reported.
The 2010 Afghanistan earthquake occurred on April 18 with a moment magnitude of 5.6. Eleven people were killed and more than 70 were injured. More than two thousand houses were destroyed. The earthquake could be felt in Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul, and elsewhere in Afghanistan, as well as in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
The 2010 Kalgoorlie-Boulder earthquake was a Richter magnitude 5.0 earthquake that occurred near the city of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Western Australia on 20 April 2010, at approximately 8:17 am WST.The earthquake caused major damage to the historic buildings in Kalgoorlie-Boulder. Its epicenter was approximately 10 km (10 mi) southwest of Kalgoorlie, at a depth of 10 km (6.2 mi). The duration of shaking lasted about 10–15 seconds and was felt up to 1,007 km (626 mi) away. It was also the largest recorded in the Goldfields region in terms of magnitude and one of the largest in Australia in terms of resulting damage. No one was killed but two people were treated at Kalgoorlie Hospital for minor injuries resulting from the earthquake. It resulted in the temporary closure of local gold mines including the Super Pit gold mine.
The 2010 Baja California earthquake (also known as 2010 Easter earthquake, 2010 Sierra El Mayor earthquake, or 2010 El Mayor – Cucapah earthquake) occurred on April 4 (Easter Sunday) with a moment magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock originated at 15:40:41 local time south of Guadalupe Victoria, Baja California, Mexico.The 89-second quake was widely felt throughout the Western United States, some southern states, and northwest Mexico. It was also the strongest to rock Southern California in at least 18 years (since the 1992 Landers earthquake (M 7.3)), if not longer: the next most recent comparable earthquake—the 1952 Kern County earthquake (M 7.3)—was 58 years earlier. Each of these earthquakes had a similar magnitude, and was also felt across a large swath of North America. Most of the damage occurred in the twin cities of Mexicali and Calexico on the Mexico–United States border.
The 2010 Bonin Islands earthquake occurred on 21 December 2010 when a MW 7.4 earthquake struck off of the Bonin Islands, Japan.The quake occurred at about 0220 local time (1720 UTC), about 155 kilometres (96 mi) east of the Bonin Islands, at a depth of around 15 km (9.3 mi). After the quake, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a warning of a possible tsunami, capable of producing a wave of up to 2 metres (6.6 ft) high near the Bonin Islands, though milder for mainland Japan. Residents of the Bonin Islands were advised to move towards higher ground, and advisories were also issued for some provinces along Japan's Pacific coast. Around 40 minutes after the initial quake, wave swells of up to 30 centimetres (12 in) were seen on the coast of the main Japanese island, though no tsunami waves were seen from the island of Chichi-jima.There were twenty-two M5.0+ aftershocks within six hours from the quake, including two with a magnitude of 5.6 that occurred at 1740 and 1741 UTC. By 27 December, 79 M5.0+ aftershocks had occurred.No damage was initially reported from the quake, though an estimated 2,000 people were able to feel the tremble. Around 170 residents of the Bonin Islands were evacuated to public buildings on Chichi-jima and Haha-jima.
The 2010 Canterbury earthquake (also known as the Darfield earthquake) struck the South Island of New Zealand with a moment magnitude of 7.1  at 4:35 a.m. local time on 4 September, and had a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Some damaging aftershocks followed the main event, the strongest of which was a magnitude 6.3 shock known as the Christchurch earthquake that occurred nearly 6 months later on 22 February 2011. Because this aftershock was centred very close to Christchurch, it was much more destructive and resulted in the deaths of 185 people, and was felt from Invercargill to Wellington.The main shock on 4 September caused widespread damage and several power outages, particularly in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city. Two residents were seriously injured, one by a collapsing chimney who died in hospital and a second by flying glass. One person died of a heart attack suffered during the quake, although this could not be directly linked to the earthquake. Mass fatalities were avoided partly due to there being few houses of unreinforced construction, although this was also aided by the quake occurring during the night when most people were off the street.The earthquake's epicentre was 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of Christchurch, near the town of Darfield. The hypocentre was at a shallow depth of 10 km. A foreshock of roughly magnitude 5.8 hit five seconds before the main quake, and strong aftershocks have been reported, up to magnitude 6.3. The initial quake lasted about 40 seconds, and was felt widely across the South Island, and in the North Island as far north as New Plymouth. As the epicentre was on land away from the coast, no tsunami occurred.The National Crisis Management Centre in the basement of the Beehive in Wellington was activated, and Civil Defence declared a state of emergency for Christchurch, the Selwyn District, and the Waimakariri District, while Selwyn District, Waimakariri and Timaru activated their emergency operation centres. Initially, a curfew was established for parts of Christchurch Central City from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am in response to the earthquake. The New Zealand Army was deployed to the worst affected areas in Canterbury.Claims from the earthquake were confirmed at being between $2.75 and $3.5 billion NZD, however it is difficult to breakout the direct cost of damage for each of the earthquake events in the 2010-2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence. The latest estimated total damage bill may be as high as $40 billion NZD, making it the fifth biggest insurance event in the world since 1953.
The 2010 Central Canada earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 5.0 in Central Canada on 23 June at about 13:41:41 EDT and lasted about 30 seconds. The epicentre was situated in the area of Buckingham, Quebec, approximately 56 kilometres (35 mi) north of Ottawa, Ontario, closest to the settlement of Val-des-Bois, Quebec. Canada's capital, Ottawa, declared this earthquake as being its most powerful in 65 years.It was felt across most of Ontario and Quebec, as well as parts of the northeastern United States, in addition to places as far as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Charleston, West Virginia, and Halifax. It was the first moderate earthquake associated with the Western Quebec Seismic Zone since 20 April 2002, when the area was affected by magnitude 5.1 Mw tremors. Southern Ontario was also affected by the 1998 magnitude 5.2 Mw Pymatuning earthquake, associated with a different seismic region (Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone).Although a 5.0 magnitude quake is only considered to be moderate, the earthquake's depth (estimates of which vary between 16.4 kilometres (10.2 mi) and 19.0 kilometres (11.8 mi)) meant that its effects were more widely felt.
The 2010 Elazığ earthquake was a 6.1 Mw earthquake that occurred on 8 March 2010 at 02:32 UTC (04:32 local time). The epicentre was Başyurt in Elazığ Province, in eastern Turkey. Initial reports in global media said as many as 57 people had died. By 10 March, reports in the Turkish media placed the death toll at 41 and later, the death toll rose to 42. Another 74 were injured, many after falling and jumping from buildings. A stampede through the streets led to further injuries.The earthquake came one week to the day after the Turkish Chamber of Civil Engineers sent a report to parliament detailing inadequate building projects and the possibility that Istanbul would be destroyed by an earthquake, which could kill tens of thousands of people, at some point in the next three decades.
The 2010 Eureka earthquake occurred on January 9 at 4:27:38 pm PST offshore of Humboldt County, California, United States. The magnitude was measured 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale, and its epicenter was located offshore in the Pacific Ocean 33 miles (53 km) west of the nearest major city, Eureka. Additionally, there was a separate earthquake further offshore of Eureka on February 4 with a slightly lower magnitude of 5.9. It was also the most significant earthquake in the Eureka area in terms of magnitude since the 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes. It was felt from Santa Cruz County, California in the south, to Eugene, Oregon in the north and to the east as far as Reno, Nevada.
The 2010 Haiti earthquake (French: Séisme de 2010 à Haïti; Haitian Creole: Tranblemanntè 12 janvye 2010 nan peyi Ayiti) was a catastrophic magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake, with an epicenter near the town of Léogâne (Ouest), approximately 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. The earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC) on Tuesday, 12 January 2010.By 24 January, at least 52 aftershocks measuring 4.5 or greater had been recorded. An estimated three million people were affected by the quake. Death toll estimates range from 100,000 to about 160,000 to Haitian government figures from 220,000 to 316,000 that have been widely characterized as deliberately inflated by the Haitian government. The government of Haiti estimated that 250,000 residences and 30,000 commercial buildings had collapsed or were severely damaged. There has been a history of national debt, prejudicial trade policies by other countries, and foreign intervention into national affairs that contributed to the pre-existing poverty and poor housing conditions that exacerbated the death toll.The earthquake caused major damage in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel and other settlements in the region. Notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed, including the Presidential Palace, the National Assembly building, the Port-au-Prince Cathedral, and the main jail. Among those killed were Archbishop of Port-au-Prince Joseph Serge Miot, and opposition leader Micha Gaillard. The headquarters of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), located in the capital, collapsed, killing many, including the Mission's Chief, Hédi Annabi.Many countries responded to appeals for humanitarian aid, pledging funds and dispatching rescue and medical teams, engineers and support personnel. Communication systems, air, land, and sea transport facilities, hospitals, and electrical networks had been damaged by the earthquake, which hampered rescue and aid efforts; confusion over who was in charge, air traffic congestion, and problems with prioritisation of flights further complicated early relief work. Port-au-Prince's morgues were overwhelmed with tens of thousands of bodies. These had to be buried in mass graves. As rescues tailed off, supplies, medical care and sanitation became priorities. Delays in aid distribution led to angry appeals from aid workers and survivors, and looting and sporadic violence were observed. On 22 January the United Nations noted that the emergency phase of the relief operation was drawing to a close, and on the following day the Haitian government officially called off the search for survivors.
A magnitude 3.8 earthquake hit Northern Illinois at 03:59:35 a.m. CST (09:59:35 a.m. UTC) on February 10, 2010. The earthquake's epicenter was about 43 miles (69 km) west-northwest of Chicago, 2 miles (3 km) east-northeast of the village of Virgil in Kane County, and 2.5 miles (4 km) northwest of the village of Lily Lake, also in Kane County, at a depth of 6.2 miles (10.0 km). The epicenter of the quake was near the Sandwich Fault Zone, which is less active and less known than another fault line in Illinois, the New Madrid Fault. The quake was felt throughout the Midwest, and as far away as Tennessee and Georgia. According to a local geologist, earthquakes in the area are uncommon, occurring only about once every ten years, and not much is known about the fault that they originate from due to the scarcity of quakes to study.
The 2010 Hosseinabad earthquake occurred on December 20 at 22:11 local time (18:41 UTC) with a moment magnitude of 6.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). It was located about 20 km from Hosseinabad (spelled variously as Ḩoseynābād or Hosein Abad) (Persian: حسين آباد), Kermān Province in south-eastern Iran, about 100 km from Bam.The earthquake killed eleven people and injured over 100. Damage was concentrated in about 20 villages in the area of Fahraj. Casualties were reported in the villages of Chah Qanbar, Tak Seyfeldini, and Sarze Rigan. Telephone service was interrupted and power outages were reported in the affected area. The intensity in Bam was IV (Light) and no damage was caused. It could also be felt in the province of Sistan-Baluchestan. According to the director of the Red Crescent of Iran, it is difficult to deliver humanitarian aid to some villages in the affected mountainous area. Some hard-to-reach areas were inaccessible due to being blocked by landslides.Moderate earthquakes can cause serious damage in the Iranian countryside, where buildings are often made of mud-bricks.
On July 30, 2010 a 5.6 magnitude earthquake occurred in Razavi Khorasan province, Iran.
On 12 January 2010, Haiti experienced a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that caused heavy damage and casualties in Jacmel. The first tremblor rocked the city at 4:40pm, but the later tremblor at 5:37pm stopped the cathedral's clock. A Jacmel radio station estimated that at least 5000 were dead from the quake itself, although mayor Zennie Edwin later reported that the figure was closer to 300-500 deaths and 4,000 injured. In the earthquake, around 70 per cent of the homes were damaged, with most of the heavier damage being suffered in the poorer neighbourhoods. Town Hall was so severely damaged that, though it survived, it had to be demolished. A small tsunami hit Jacmel Bay, with the ocean receding, leaving fish high and dry on the seabed, and rushing back in, four times.Among the facilities destroyed in the earthquake was Pazapa (Creole for "Step by step"), a charity run from two buildings in downtown Jacmel which helped disabled children. The charity's two rented buildings suffered condemning damage, just after the children left for the day, in the quake. The Ciné Institute, Haiti's sole film school, was also destroyed in the quake. Also destroyed was the Fosaj art school.Relief efforts had been slow because of the lack of supplies and focus on the capital Port-au-Prince. However, efforts by the Ciné Institute drew rescue and relief workers to Jacmel. Colombian rescue workers from Bogota firefighters arrived first, followed by Chilean doctors, 4 French NGOs (FAUSI, DASU, PUI, CMS) brought by sea on a Dominican Republic navy boat, and Sri Lankan workers answered the call. The Haitian government had requested to the Canadian government that they concentrate relief efforts on the area of Jacmel. Canadian Governor General Michaëlle Jean's parents were born in Jacmel, which she visited frequently as a child.The Jacmel Airport suffered incapacitating damage during the earthquake and was initially unable to receive the C-130 aircraft, though it was expected to open for C-130's on January 20. However, it has been used since 14 January 2010 as a base of operations for scouting the area with Canadian CH-146 Griffon helicopters, in advance of the relief efforts. The small, 1 km (3,300 ft) airstrip in Jacmel is too small to process the larger C-17 aircraft that were to fly in supplies. As of January 18, 2010 the Canadian navy frigate HMCS Halifax with a crew of 225, has been deployed at Jacmel to help in the relief efforts. The crew of the Halifax will be assisting Canada's Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) which was brought to the area by helicopter on January 18 as well. The port is shallow, and was not large enough to handle the Halifax so supplies had to be shipped to the shore and back again. Together DART and the Halifax crew primarily concentrated on setting up a field hospital and a water purification system. The first Canadian CC-130 flight into Jacmel Airport occurred on 19 January 2010. Also sent to Jacmel, is a mobile surgical hospital donated by a Swiss relief agency. The Cuban military set up a field hospital in the region.A 22-day-old baby girl, Elisabeth Joassaint, was found in the ruins of her home on 19 January 2010 by a team of French rescuers from the NGO FAUSI (Fabien Lampert, Alexandre Pertin and Eric Mellet), and rushed to the hospital by Colombian medic Mauricio Milanes. Her mother Michelène was unable to get news about her since the earthquake struck. The girl was found many days beyond the usual survival period of three days without water. She recovered well and still lives with her mother in Jacmel. She was the youngest survivor of the Haiti earthquake, and the only one found in Jacmel.As of the 22nd, the DART facility moved from next to the Saint-Michel Hospital to the harbourfront. The DART field hospital was set up on the pier, as is operating full out. The DART water production plant that cleans sea water or river water was set up on a jetty.As of the 24th, refugee camps have started to get organized, with the start of construction of proper latrines. Food distribution is delivered by the UN, with Canadian soldiers providing security, and Haitian Girl Guides and Boy Scouts handling crowd control and organization. Canadian military firefighters are inspecting buildings in Jacmel to ascertain which are structurally sound and usable. A Canadian Army clinic has been set up on the beach. The Canadian Army has set up a tent city for residents who have lost their homes.As of the 26th, the first wave of rescue workers have started rotating out of Jacmel. The DART water production plant has started producing water, though the river water was less usable than sea water, so production is slower. River water has 900ppm of dissolved solids while sea water has 35,000ppm.On the 28th, the first post-quake baby was born at the Canadian clinic. The main wharf at the port is handling two ships a day with relief supplies from the Dominican Republic.On the 29th, Choice Hotels announced that it would continue with its plans to open two hotels in Jacmel, although opening would be delayed. The 32-room hotel that will be converted into a Comfort Inn was not damaged in the quake, and Choice Hotels is delivering aid supplies to guests and refugees currently housed in the facility. Choice Hotels will also continue with plans to open a 120-room hotel under the Ascend Collection banner as the "Belle Rive". This represents the first time in a decade that a multinational brand hotel chain has come to Haiti (Holiday Inn vacated Haiti, and Hilton cancelled its plans in Haiti).As of 2 February, the École Wolfe Displaced Persons Camp, had been outfitted with a clean water bladder, latrines, and showers. The refugee camp contained more than 200 people, and now had a clean water supply.As of 3 February, Patrimoine Sans Frontière has announced a mission to Jacmel, to attempt to preserve as much heritage architecture as possible, while also ensuring minimal safety standards.On 19 February, HMCS Halifax finished it operational tour, and left Jacmel.After seeing the films from Cine Institute, residents of sister city, Gainesville, Florida, USA, voiced a commitment to renew their friendship and commit to help Jacmel. Community leaders arrived in Jacmel on February 20. Meanwhile, volunteers in Gainesville meet every week and have created a non-profit with the sole intent helping Jacmel recover. A city wide music festival will be held at the Florida School of Massage in Gainesville to raise money for Jacmel.In early March, airport staff have revealed intentions to expand the runway from 3,300 ft to 5000–6000 ft, to allow for large passenger plane access.As of 4 March, Swiss-based Medair has started providing permanent shelters in Jacmel, that have evolved from metal-framed tents to metal-clad sheds. With residents clearing their own lots, Medair would provide the shelter. Residents of the Pinchinat tent city in Jacmel are receiving one meal a day. Pinchinat contains about 6000 residents.On 9 March, the dockside Canadian walk-in medical clinic closed, after treating more than 10,000 patients.On 15 March, some schools reopened.As of 16 March, the Canadian military have vacated Jacmel.In the wake of the Canadian military pullout, Jacmel was left missing many things needed to operate as a reception and distribution hub. The airport could no longer process international flights, as no equipment remained to operate the control tower, nor heavy equipment to process the planes, or security to police supplies at the airport. The seaport was left without heavy equipment to handle cargo on ships, and without security to secure the port.
The 2010 Kaohsiung earthquakes measuring 6.4, and 6.7 ML occurred on Thursday, March 4 at 8:20 a.m. local time. The epicenter was located in the mountainous area of Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City) of the southwestern Taiwan. It was the most powerful earthquake in Kaohsiung since 1900. The earthquake did not cause any deaths, but 96 people were injured.
The May 2010 Northern Sumatra earthquake was a 7.2 Mw earthquake that occurred on May 9, 2010, at 12:59 PM local time (5:59 UTC), off the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. The epicenter was 215 km from Banda Aceh. According to USGS, it is likely that this earthquake occurred along the interface of the Indo-Australia Plate and the Sunda Plate. It was one of a sequence of large earthquakes along the Sunda megathrust in 2000s. Besides in Indonesia, this earthquake was also felt in Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Thailand. Minor damage was reported in the control tower of an airport near Meulaboh.
The 2010 Mindanao earthquakes occurred in the Southern Philippines in the Moro Gulf. The sequence of events took place over several days in late July, and consisted of three primary shocks that were all over M7, but there were no reports of damage or casualties as they occurred far too deep (over 500 kilometres (310 mi)) to pose any serious threat.
On July 18, 2010 a 7.3 magnitude earthquake occurred in New Britain, Papua New Guinea. This quake was the second in a series of two earthquakes to hit New Britain on July 18, the first one measuring magnitude 6.9. A tsunami warning was issued but later lifted. Some houses in the area of the earthquake were reported collapsed.Another strong earthquake struck New Britain on August 4, 22:01:45 UTC (8:01:45 am local time), measuring magnitude 7.0 at a depth of 54 km (33.6 mi). The maximum Mercalli intensity of the August earthquake was also VII (Very strong).
The 2010 Oaxaca earthquake struck Oaxaca, Mexico on June 30, 2010, measuring 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale. Many people in different cities left their beds and ran into the street, as the quake struck at 2:22 am. Helicopters and police vehicles were sent to inspect possible damages in Mexico City, primarily in downtown and central areas, where some buildings were evacuated. In Mexico City, some cases of power outage in Azcapotzalco, Iztapalapa, and Benito Juárez and cracks in buildings were reported. 1 person died in San Andrés Huaxpaltepec, Oaxaca.
The 2010 Papua earthquake occurred on June 16 at 12:16 local time (03:16 UTC) in Papua province of Indonesia. The magnitude 7.0 mainshock was preceded by an Mw 6.2 foreshock 10 minutes earlier, and was followed 42 minutes later by an Mw 6.6 aftershock.
The 2010 Pichilemu earthquake (Spanish: Terremoto de Pichilemu de 2010), also known as the Libertador O'Higgins earthquake, was a 6.9 MW intraplate earthquake that struck Chile's O'Higgins Region on 11 March 2010. The earthquake was centred 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) northwest of the city of Pichilemu, according to the University of Chile Seismological Service.The earthquake was caused by increased regional stress arising from an earthquake on 27 February, centered offshore Maule Region, which was felt throughout central Chile. The 11 March earthquake was at first thought to be an aftershock from the 27 February event, but University of Chile Seismologist Jaime Campos identified it as an "independent earthquake". The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center pointed out the possibility of local tsunamis within 100 kilometres (62 mi) of the epicentre, although small, but violent waves were seen in the Pichilemu and Bucalemu area. One person was reported dead. At least eleven aftershocks immediately followed, causing panic throughout coastal towns between the Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions.The earthquake was specially destructive in the epicentre town, Pichilemu, capital of Cardenal Caro Province. The city hosts five National Monuments of Chile, of which two, the Agustín Ross Park and the Agustín Ross Cultural Centre, were seriously damaged by the earthquake. It also damaged the villages of La Aguada and Cardonal de Panilonco. Rancagua, the capital of O'Higgins Region, was also damaged, leading President Sebastián Piñera to declare a catastrophe state in O'Higgins Region.
The 2010 Salta earthquake occurred on February 27 at 12:45:36 local time in Salta Province, Argentina and had a magnitude of 6.3. It occurred less than 12 hours after the far larger 2010 Chile earthquake, which killed over 500 people. Initially thought to be an aftershock of the Chile earthquake, scientists later established that the earthquakes were unrelated. It took place just to the north of the city of Salta. The quake killed two people, and injured dozens (possibly up to 100 people).
The 2010 Serbia earthquake (also referred to as the Kraljevo earthquake) occurred on 3 November in central Serbia just several kilometers from Kraljevo. The earthquake had moment magnitude of 5.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). The shock was felt across the country, including the capital Belgrade, and in neighboring countries. Two people were killed and over 100 suffered light injuries. There were 5,967 structures that sustained some damages, 1,551 declared unsafe for use and require repairment, and 138 were damaged beyond repair. There were more than 350 weaker aftershocks including a 4.3 Mw earthquake on November 4.
The 2010 Solomon Islands earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 7.1 on January 3 at 22:36:28 (UTC). A tsunami measuring approximately 10 feet affected some parts of the islands. The earthquake was the largest in a series of quakes to strike the Solomon Islands over the preceding days. The 7.1 mainshock was preceded by a 6.6 magnitude foreshock some 48 minutes previous. As many as 1,000 people were left homeless on the island of Rendova after the earthquake and tsunami destroyed approximately 200 homes.
The April 2010 Sumatra earthquake occurred on April 7 at 5:15 AM local time with a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock occurred near Banyak Islands, off the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. A tsunami watch was issued according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu which was later canceled. A 40 cm surge was reported in the Banyak Islands an hour after the quake, along with 62 injuries. Power outages were reported throughout the province of North Sumatra as well as in Aceh. This quake is one of the sequence of large earthquakes along the Sunda megathrust in 2000s.In Simeulue Regency, 21 were hospitalized in Gunung Putih, Teluk Dalam subdistrict, and 41 were injured in Teupah Selatan subdistrict. Some of the injured were treated at Simeulue general hospital in Sinabang.
The October 2010 Sumatra earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 7.7  on 25 October off the western coast of Sumatra at 21:42 local time (14:42 UTC). The earthquake occurred on the same fault that produced the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It was widely felt across the provinces of Bengkulu and West Sumatra and resulted in a substantial localized tsunami that struck the Mentawai Islands.
The 2010 Yushu earthquake struck on April 14 and registered a magnitude of 6.9Mw (USGS, EMSC) or 7.1Ms (CEA, CENC). It originated in Yushu, Qinghai, China, at 7:49 am local time. According to the Xinhua News Agency, 2,698 people have been confirmed dead, 270 missing, and 12,135 injured of which 1,434 are severely injured. The epicenter was located in Rima village (日玛村/日麻村), Upper Laxiu township (上拉秀乡) of Yushu County, in remote and rugged terrain, near the border of Tibet Autonomous Region. The epicenter is about 30 km from Gyêgu town or Jyekundo, the seat of Yushu County, and about 240 km from Qamdo. The epicenter was in a sparsely populated area on the Tibetan plateau that is regularly hit by earthquakes.The 12th century Thrangu Monastery and surrounding villages were severely damaged and many monks and villagers were killed.
2011 Aceh Singkil earthquake that occurred 59 kilometers northeast of Singkil, Singkil, Aceh by force from 6.6 to 6.7 SR at 00:55 am on September 6, 2011 (17:55 UTC 5 September 2011). According to BMKG, this earthquake was at a depth of 78 km. However, according to the USGS, the quake was located at a depth of 91 km.The earthquake was also felt to Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Perak, Kedah and Penang in Malaysia. The intensity was MM III in George Town, Penang and MM II in Kuala Lumpur.
The 2011 Burma earthquake (Burmese: ၂၀၁၁ မြန်မာငလျင်) occurred with a magnitude 6.9 on 24 March that had its epicenter in the east of Shan State in Burma (Myanmar) with a hypocenter 10 km deep. It had two aftershocks, one of magnitude 4.8, another at magnitude 5.4, and two subsequent shocks at magnitude 5.0 and 6.2. The quake's epicentre was 70 miles (110 km) from the northern Thai city of Chiang Rai, north of Mae Sai and southeast of Kentung.
The 2011 Colorado earthquake occurred on August 22 at 11:46 PM MDT with a moment magnitude of 5.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of V (Moderate). The epicenter of the intraplate earthquake was 10 mi (20 km) west northwest of Trinidad, Colorado, and 180 mi (290 km) south of Denver, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). It was the largest natural earthquake to affect Colorado for more than a hundred years.The earthquake occurred as part of a swarm of smaller quakes that started the previous day. The last time the Colorado region received a series of earthquakes was in 2001, when about a dozen smaller-sized temblors were recorded. The shock occurred as a result of normal faulting and was similar in depth, style and location to the events that made up the 2001 swarm.
The 2011 Fergana Valley earthquake affected Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan at 01:35 local time on 20 July. The dip-slip shock had a moment magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Its epicenter was located just inside Kyrgyzstan's border in the Fergana Valley region. Fourteen were killed and eighty-six were injured.
The 2011 Guerrero earthquake struck with a moment magnitude of 5.7 in southern Mexico at 08:24 local time on Thursday, 5 May. It was positioned west of Ometepec, Guerrero, with a focal depth of 24 km (14.9 mi), and was lightly felt in many adjacent areas.Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, prompting evacuations and causing panic among many. Following the quake, police patrolled city streets for safety reasons and damage assessments were carried out across the affected region. There were no casualties, though two local police stations suffered slight damage. A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event, of which the strongest measured a magnitude of 4.1 (ML).
The 2011 Kütahya earthquake was a strong magnitude 5.8 Mw earthquake that struck inland near a populous region of western Turkey at 23:15 EEST (20:15 UTC) on 19 May. With an epicenter just to the east of Simav, it occurred at an estimated depth of 9.1 kilometers (5.7 mi), resulting in strong shaking in much of Kütahya.Many locals panicked and power was lost to most of Simav. A hospital in Simav reported an unknown number of injuries, and some buildings sustained damage. An elderly woman in İnegöl suffered a heart attack in the immediate aftermath of the tremor, and was later confirmed dead. In Simav, one person was killed after being struck by a concrete block. More than 450 weak aftershocks followed; the strongest registered at a magnitude of 4.6.
The 2011 Lorca earthquake (Spanish: Terremoto de Lorca de 2011) was a moderate magnitude 5.1 Mw earthquake that caused significant localized damage in the Region of Murcia, Spain. Centred at a very shallow depth of 1 km (0.6 mi) near the town of Lorca, it occurred at 18:47 CEST (16:47 UTC) on 11 May 2011, causing panic among locals and displacing many from their homes. The quake was preceded by a magnitude 4.4 (Mw) foreshock at 17:05 (15:05 UTC), that inflicted substantial damage to many older structures in the area, including the historical Espolón Tower of Lorca Castle, the Hermitage of San Clemente and the Convent of Virgen de Las Huertas. Three people were killed by a falling cornice. A total of nine deaths have been confirmed, while dozens are reported injured. The earthquake was the worst to hit the region since a 5.0 Mw tremor struck west of Albolote, Granada in 1956.
The 2011 Nabro eruption was an eruption of the Nabro stratovolcano in the Southern Red Sea Region of Eritrea, which began on 12 June 2011 after a series of earthquakes. The eruption killed seven and possibly a further 31 people and is estimated to be the highest altitude injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) ever observed by satellite. The Mount Pinatubo eruption 20 years earlier emitted ten times more SO2. The ash cloud from the eruption reached altitudes which disrupted airline traffic in the region. Until the eruption began, the volcano had no records of historical eruptions.
The 2011 Oklahoma earthquake was a 5.6 magnitude intraplate earthquake which occurred near Prague, Oklahoma near several active hydraulic fracturing waste water injection wells on November 5 at 10:53 p.m. CDT (03:53 UTC November 6) in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), it was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma. The previous record was a 5.5 magnitude earthquake that struck near the town of El Reno in 1952. The quake's epicenter was approximately 44 miles (71 km) east-northeast of Oklahoma City, near the town of Sparks and was felt in the neighboring states of Texas, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri and even as far away as Tennessee and Wisconsin. The quake followed several minor quakes earlier in the day, including a 4.7 magnitude foreshock. The quake had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in the area closest to the epicenter. Numerous aftershocks were detected after the main quake, with a few registering at 4.0 magnitude.In March 28, 2016 the USGS released the USGS National Seismic Hazard Map which concluded that the primary cause of the earthquake in Oklahoma in 2011 was pressure on fault lines from cumulative effects of injecting oil drilling wastewater under high pressure into the underground. Although the 2011 earthquake was the largest on record, the USGS reported that the central and eastern U.S. (CEUS) has undergone the most dramatic increase in seismic activity in the United States since 2009 with an average of 318 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 a year up from 24 a year from 1973 to 2008. In 2015 there were 1,010 earthquakes in the CEUS region. By mid-March, 2016 there were already 226 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 and larger in the CEUS. "Earthquake rates have recently increased markedly in multiple areas of the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), especially since 2010, and scientific studies have linked the majority of this increased activity to wastewater injection in deep disposal wells."
The 2011 Pakistan earthquake was a magnitude Mw 7.2 earthquake that had its epicenter 45 kilometers west of Dalbandin in Balochistan. The epicenter is located in a sparsely populated area. The United States Geological Survey reported the earthquake took place on January 18, 2011 at 20:23:17 UTC (on January 19 at 01:23 AM local time) at 28.838°N, 63.974°E. The depth of the earthquake was reported to be 84 kilometres (52 mi).Tremors after the earthquake reached neighboring countries including Bahrain, UAE, Oman, Iran, Afghanistan, and India a few moments after the quake. The earthquake was felt with Mercali intensity MM IV in Islamabad, MM IV Karachi, MM IV in Muscat, MM IV in Delhi, MM III in Kabul, MM III in Dubai, and MM III Abu Dhabi. About 200 mud houses, including some government offices, were reported damaged in the Dalbandin area of Pakistan with a cost of 2.1 billion US dollars. Two women died of heart attacks in Quetta after the earthquake, about 330 km northeast of the epicenter, where the intensity was MM IV.The tectonic environment of this region is dominated by the motions of the Arabian Plate, the Indian Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. This earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting within the lithosphere of the subducted Arabian Plate.
The 2011 Sikkim earthquake (also known as the 2011 Himalayan earthquake) occurred with a moment magnitude of 6.9 and was centered within the Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, near the border of Nepal and the Indian state of Sikkim, at 18:10 IST on Sunday, 18 September. The earthquake was felt across northeastern India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and southern Tibet.At least 111 people were killed in the earthquake. Most of the deaths occurred in Sikkim, with reports of fatalities in and near Singtam in the East Sikkim district. Several buildings collapsed in Gangtok. Eleven are reported dead in Nepal, including three killed when a wall collapsed in the British Embassy in Kathmandu. Elsewhere, structural damage occurred in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and across Tibet; another seven fatalities were confirmed in the latter region.The quake came just a few days after an earthquake of 4.2 magnitude hit Haryana's Sonipat district, sending tremors in New Delhi. The earthquake was the fourth significant earthquake in India of September 2011.Exactly a year after the original earthquake at 5:55 pm on 18 September 2012, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 struck Sikkim, sparking panic among the people observing the anniversary of the original quake.
The 2011 Virginia earthquake occurred on August 23 at 1:51:04 p.m. local time in the Piedmont region of the US state of Virginia. The epicenter, in Louisa County, was 61 km (38 mi) northwest of Richmond and 8 km (5 mi) south-southwest of the town of Mineral. It was an intraplate earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Several aftershocks, ranging up to 4.5 Mw in magnitude, occurred after the main tremor.The earthquake, along with a magnitude–5.8 quake on the New York–Ontario border in 1944, is the largest to have occurred in the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains since an earthquake centered in Giles County in western Virginia occurred during 1897, with an estimated magnitude of 5.8.The quake was felt across more than a dozen U.S. states and in several Canadian provinces, and was felt by more people than any other quake in U.S. history. No deaths and only minor injuries were reported. Minor and moderate damage to buildings was widespread and was estimated by one risk-modeling company at $200 million to $300 million, of which about $100 million was insured.The earthquake prompted research that revealed that the farthest landslide from the epicenter was 150 miles (240 km), by far the greatest landslide distance recorded from any other earthquake of similar magnitude. Previous studies of worldwide earthquakes indicated that landslides occurred no farther than 36 miles (58 km) from the epicenter of a magnitude 5.8 earthquake. The Virginia earthquake study suggested that the added information about East Coast earthquakes may prompt a revision of equations that predict ground shaking.
The 2011 Zumpango earthquake occurred at 19:47 local time on 10 December with a moment magnitude of 6.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). Its epicenter was located in the city Zumpango, Guerrero, roughly equidistant between the metropolitan areas of Mexico City and Acapulco. The quake was felt in Guerrero, Michoacán, Mexico State, Mexico City and Puebla.Multiple deaths and injuries resulted from the earthquake, although the effects were minimized because the hypocenter was relatively deep at 65 kilometers. The resulting damage was minimal, but during the panic people evacuated buildings in Mexico City.
The April 2011 Fukushima earthquake (福島県浜通り地震, Fukushima-ken Hamadōri jishin, lit. "Fukushima Hamadōri earthquake") was a potent magnitude 6.6 Mw intraplate aftershock that occurred at 17:16 JST (08:16 UTC) on Monday, 11 April 2011, in the Hamadōri region of Fukushima, Japan. With a shallow focus of 13 km (8.1 mi), the earthquake was centred inland about 36 km (22 mi) west of Iwaki, causing widespread strong to locally severe shaking. It was one of many aftershocks to follow the 11 March Tōhoku earthquake, and the strongest to have its epicentre located inland.The earthquake occurred as a result of normal faulting to the west of Iwaki and triggered numerous landslides across adjacent mountainous areas. A few fires broke out, and 220,000 households lost electricity. Officials issued localised tsunami alerts, though no significant waves were generated. The earthquake caused little structural damage, but killed four people and injured ten others. The strong ground movements triggered the reactivation of a nearby geological fault, prompting researchers to conduct extensive surveys in the region.
An earthquake occurred in Christchurch on 22 February 2011 at 12:51 p.m. local time (23:51 21 February UTC) and registered 6.3 on the Richter scale. The earthquake struck the Canterbury Region in New Zealand's South Island and was centred 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) west of the port town of Lyttelton, and 10 kilometres (6 mi) south-east of the centre of Christchurch, at the time New Zealand's second-most populous city. The earthquake caused widespread damage across Christchurch, killing 185 people in the nation's third deadliest natural disaster.Christchurch's central city and eastern suburbs were badly affected, with damage to buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the magnitude 7.1 Canterbury earthquake of 4 September 2010 and its aftershocks. Significant liquefaction affected the eastern suburbs, producing around 400,000 tonnes of silt. The earthquake was felt across the South Island and parts of the lower and central North Island. While the initial quake only lasted for approximately 10 seconds, the damage was severe because of the location and shallowness of the earthquake's epicentre in relation to Christchurch and previous quake damage. Subsequent population loss saw the Christchurch main urban area fall behind the Wellington equivalent to decrease from second to third most populous area in New Zealand.
The June 2011 Christchurch earthquake was a shallow magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake that occurred on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST (02:20 UTC). It was centred at a depth of 6 km (3.8 mi), about 10 km (6 mi) from Christchurch, which had previously been devastated by another magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake in February 2011. The June quake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor that struck the region at a slightly deeper 8.9 km (5.5 mi). The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw at a depth of about 9 km (5.6 mi).The earthquake produced severe shaking that registered VIII on the Mercalli scale in and around the city of Christchurch, destroying some buildings and causing additional damage to many structures affected by previous earthquakes. The damaged tower of the historic Lyttelton Timeball Station collapsed before dismantling work could be completed. The earthquake downed phone lines and triggered widespread outages, which left around 54,000 households without power. Rebuilding costs in Christchurch increased by NZ$6 billion (US$4.8 billion) owing to the additional damage from the quake. Forty-six people suffered injuries, and one elderly man died after being knocked unconscious.
The November 2011 Myanmar earthquake was a magnitude 5.9 (Mw) moderate earthquake epicentered at Myanmar, about 130 km east of Manipur capital Imphal, India, on 21 November 2011 at 09:45 local time. The tremor was also felt in Indian states of Assam, Nagaland, Kolkata and some areas of north Bengal and in Bangladesh.The region had previously experienced one of the worst earthquakes in 1897, measuring 8.1 on the Richter scale, that claimed the lives of over 1,500 people. Again in September 2011, more than 50 people died after a killer quake measuring 6.9 had shook the region.
The 2011 earthquake off the Pacific coast of Tōhoku (東北地方太平洋沖地震, Tōhoku-chihō Taiheiyō Oki Jishin) was a magnitude 9.0 (Mw) undersea megathrust earthquake off the coast of Japan that occurred at 14:46 JST (05:46 UTC) on Friday 11 March 2011, with the epicentre approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) east of the Oshika Peninsula of Tōhoku and the hypocenter at an underwater depth of approximately 30 km (19 mi). The earthquake is also often referred to in Japan as the Great East Japan earthquake (東日本大震災, Higashi nihon daishinsai) and also known as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, and the 3.11 earthquake. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded to have hit Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The earthquake triggered powerful tsunami waves that reached heights of up to 40.5 metres (133 ft) in Miyako in Tōhoku's Iwate Prefecture, and which, in the Sendai area, travelled up to 10 km (6 mi) inland. The earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4 m (8 ft) east, shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm (4 in) and 25 cm (10 in), and generated sound waves detected by the low-orbiting GOCE satellite.On 10 March 2015, a Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,894 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,562 people missing across twenty prefectures, as well as 228,863 people living away from their home in either temporary housing or due to permanent relocation. A 10 February 2014 agency report listed 127,290 buildings totally collapsed, with a further 272,788 buildings 'half collapsed', and another 747,989 buildings partially damaged. The earthquake and tsunami also caused extensive and severe structural damage in north-eastern Japan, including heavy damage to roads and railways as well as fires in many areas, and a dam collapse. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said, "In the 65 years after the end of World War II, this is the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan." Around 4.4 million households in northeastern Japan were left without electricity and 1.5 million without water.The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Many electrical generators were taken down, and at least three nuclear reactors suffered explosions due to hydrogen gas that had built up within their outer containment buildings after cooling system failure resulting from the loss of electrical power. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated.Early estimates placed insured losses from the earthquake alone at US$14.5 to $34.6 billion. The Bank of Japan offered ¥15 trillion (US$183 billion) to the banking system on 14 March in an effort to normalize market conditions. The World Bank's estimated economic cost was US$235 billion, making it the costliest natural disaster in world history.
The 2011 Van earthquake occurred in eastern Turkey near the city of Van on 23 October at 13:41 local time. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). It occurred at a shallow depth, causing heavy shaking across much of eastern Turkey and lighter tremors across neighboring parts of the South Caucasus and Levant. According to Disasters and Emergency Situations Directorate of Turkey AFAD on 30 October, the earthquake killed 604 and injured 4,152. At least 11,232 buildings sustained damage in the region, 6,017 of which were found to be uninhabitable. The uninhabitable homes left as much as 8,321 households with an average household population of around 7.6 homeless in the province; this could mean that at least around 60,000 people were left homeless. The other 5,215 have been damaged but are habitable.
The 2011 Yunnan earthquake was a 5.4 magnitude earthquake that occurred on 10 March 2011 at 12:58 CST, with its epicenter in Yingjiang County, Yunnan, People's Republic of China, near the Burmese border. A total of 26 people died and 313 were injured with 133 in serious condition. China's Xinhua reports that up to seven aftershocks, measuring up to a magnitude of 4.7, followed the initial quake, which caused a total of 127,000 people to be evacuated to nearby shelters. It joined over 1,000 other minor tremors that affected the region in the two preceding months. Following damage surveys, officials reported that 1,039 buildings were destroyed and 4,994 more were seriously damaged. The earthquake occurred one day before a much larger earthquake struck Japan that also formed a tsunami.
A magnitude 5.4 earthquake struck Gippsland near Moe at 8.55 pm on 19 June 2012, at a shallow depth of 9.9 km. It was the strongest recorded in Victoria in at least three decades, with some sources suggesting it was the strongest in over a century. It was felt across much of Victoria and parts of New South Wales, with strong shaking reported across the state capital, Melbourne. Some minor building damage was reported in the Latrobe Valley close to the epicentre, and in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Around 30 requests for help were made to the SES, mainly due to cracked walls and ceilings, and a number of local businesses lost some stock. Approximately 60 aftershocks were recorded the following day, but most of these were not felt.A magnitude 4.5 aftershock occurred in the same area at 7.11 pm on 20 July 2012 at a similar depth. This tremor was felt across south Gippsland, as well as Melbourne and the Mornington Peninsula. This aftershock is the strongest so far of over 200 that have occurred since the initial quake.
The 2012 Kamaishi earthquake occurred near the city of Kamaishi, Japan, on December 7. The magnitude 7.3 shock generated a small tsunami, with waves up to 1 m high, that hit Ishinomaki in Miyagi Prefecture. It occurred at a depth of 36 km within the Pacific Plate and was the result of reverse faulting, about 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of the Japan Trench.
The 2012 Zohan earthquake occurred on December 5 at 20:38 IRST with a moment magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of VI (Strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The shock occurred near the city of Zohan, Qayen and Birjand in South Khorasan Province, Iran. It struck 42 km ESE from Qayen. At least 8 people were killed and 23 people were injured.
On 11 June 2012, two moderate earthquakes struck northern Afghanistan, causing a large landslide. The landslide buried the town of Sayi Hazara, trapping 71 people. After four days of digging, only five bodies were recovered and the search was called off. Overall, 75 people were killed and 13 others were injured.
The 2012 East Azerbaijan earthquakes occurred near the cities of Ahar and Varzaqan in Iran's East Azerbaijan Province, on August 11, 2012, at 16:53 Iran Standard Time. The doublet were separated by eleven minutes, measured 6.4 and 6.3 on the moment magnitude scale, and occurred 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Tabriz. At least 306 people died and more than 3,000 others were injured, primarily in the rural and mountainous areas to the northeast of Tabriz (though 45 died in the city of Ahar). The shocks were felt in Armenia and Azerbaijan, though no major damage was reported.
The 2012 Pernik earthquake was a 5.6 Mw magnitude earthquake, which struck 24 km (15 miles) west of Bulgaria's capital Sofia and 9 km (6 miles) north-northwest of the provincial center Pernik on 22 May 2012 at 3:00 am local time (00:00 UTC) at a depth of 9.4 kilometers (5.8 mi).
The 2012 Chiba earthquake (千葉県東方沖地震, Chiba-ken Toho-oki Jishin, lit. "Offshore Eastern Chiba Earthquake") occurred along the northeastern coast of Chiba Prefecture, Japan at 21:05 JST (12:05 UTC) on Wednesday, 14 March. Although its epicentre lay just offshore near Chōshi city, the shallow magnitude 6.1 Mj earthquake produced considerable shaking inland through much of the Bōsō Peninsula and lower Ibaraki Prefecture. It occurred as a result of normal faulting in a seismically quiet region, possibly in response to the magnitude 9.0 Mw 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.
The 2012 Costa Rica earthquake occurred at 08:42 local time (14:42 UTC) on September 5, 2012. The epicenter of the 7.6 Mw earthquake was in the Nicoya Peninsula, 11 kilometers east-southeast of Nicoya. A tsunami warning was issued shortly afterwards, but later cancelled. Two people are known to have died, one from a heart attack and another, a construction worker, crushed by a collapsing wall. It was the second strongest earthquake recorded in Costa Rica's history, following the 1991 Limon earthquake.
The 2012 Guatemala earthquake occurred on November 7 at 10:35:47 local time. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The epicenter was located in the Pacific Ocean, 35 kilometres (22 mi) south of Champerico in the department of Retalhuleu. The region is one of many earthquakes, where the Cocos Plate is being subducted along the Middle America Trench beneath the North American and the Caribbean Plates, near their triple junction.The quake was reportedly felt in Guatemala and in parts of Mexico, El Salvador, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Damage to buildings was reported in several cities in Guatemala, including San Marcos, Quetzaltenango and the capital Guatemala City. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning about the possibility of a local tsunami within 100 to 200 miles (160 to 320 km) of the epicenter.With 39 dead, this is the most intense and deadliest earthquake that has hit Guatemala since the earthquake of 1976.
The 2012 Guerrero–Oaxaca earthquake struck southern Mexico with a moment magnitude of 7.4 at 12:02 local time on Tuesday, 20 March. Its epicenter was near Ometepec, in the border between the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca. With a shallow focus of 15 to 20 km, the earthquake caused strong shaking over a large area along the Oaxaca–Guerrero border and the adjacent Pacific coastline. Significant tremors were felt in areas up to several hundred kilometers away, including Mexico City and also in Guatemala. Two people were killed and over 30,000 houses were damaged or destroyed.
The 2012 Haida Gwaii earthquake occurred just after 8:04 p.m. PDT on October 27. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of V (Moderate). The earthquake's epicentre was on Moresby Island of the Haida Gwaii archipelago (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands). This was the second largest Canadian earthquake ever recorded by a seismometer, after the 1949 Queen Charlotte Islands earthquake, about 135 kilometres (84 mi) away.
The 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes were magnitude 8.6 and 8.2 Mw undersea earthquakes that struck near the Indonesian province of Aceh on 11 April at 15:38 local time. Initially, authorities feared that the initial earthquake would cause a tsunami and warnings were issued across the Indian Ocean; however, these warnings were subsequently cancelled. The earthquake was the 13th strongest earthquake since 1900, an unusually strong intraplate earthquake, and the largest strike-slip earthquake ever recorded.
In May 2012, two major earthquakes occurred in Northern Italy, causing 27 deaths and widespread damage.The first earthquake, registering magnitude 6.1, struck in the Emilia-Romagna region, about 36 kilometres (22 mi) north of the city of Bologna, on 20 May at 04:03 local time (02:03 UTC). The epicentre was between Finale Emilia, Bondeno and Sermide. Two aftershocks of magnitude 5.2 occurred, one approximately an hour after the main event and another approximately eleven hours after the main event. Seven people were killed.A magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck the same area nine days later, on 29 May, causing an additional twenty deaths and widespread damage, particularly to buildings already weakened by the 20 May earthquake. The epicentre was in Medolla at a depth of about 10 kilometres (6 mi).
The 2012 Michoacán earthquake occurred in Mexico on 11 April with a moment magnitude of 6.5. It was the third major quake to hit Mexico in less than a month.
On 3 July 2012 at 10:36 pm (10:36 UTC), a major earthquake struck off the coast of New Zealand's North Island. New Zealand's GeoNet reported a magnitude of 6.5 (ML), whereas the United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude 6.3 (MW). The earthquake was felt throughout New Zealand, although there seems to have been mostly minor damage.Some residents on the Horowhenua coast evacuated to higher ground in anticipation of a tsunami, although Civil Defence believed the risk was low.The earthquake was followed by an aftershock of magnitude 4.6 at around 10:45 pm.
An earthquake off the coast of Samar occurred on August 31, 2012, at 20:47 local time (12:47 UTC) in the Philippines. The populated islands of Visayas were struck by an earthquake of magnitude Mw 7.6. The earthquake has a depth of 34.9 km (21.7 miles). A tsunami warning was announced within the Pacific area and was later lifted after two hours. The Philippine archipelago is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where earthquakes and volcanic activity are common.
The 2012 Shwebo earthquake occurred at 07:42 local time (01:12 UTC) on 11 November in Myanmar. It had a magnitude of 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicenter was near the town of Male, 52 km NNE of the city of Shwebo, 64 km west of Mogok and 120 km north of Mandalay. Significant damage and possible casualties have been reported from near the epicenter, with up to 26 people dead and many more injured. Part of a bridge under construction fell into the Irrawaddy River near Shwebo and a gold mine collapsed at Sintku.  An aftershock with a magnitude of 5.8 followed at 17:24 local time (10:54 UTC).
The 2012 Visayas earthquake occurred on February 6 at 11:49 PST with a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum intensity of VII (Destructive) off the coast of Negros Oriental, Philippines. The epicenter of the undersea blind thrust earthquake was approximately 72 kilometres (45 mi) north of Dumaguete, Negros Oriental.
The 2012 Yangzhou earthquake occurred in Jiangsu Province of the People's Republic of China at 20:11(UTC+8) in Yangzhou on July 20.
On 7 September 2012, a series of earthquakes occurred in Yiliang County, Zhaotong, Yunnan. The two main shocks occurred at 11:19 and 12:16 China Standard Time (03:19 and 04:16 UTC). The earthquakes left 81 people dead and 821 injured. According to the officials, at least 100,000 people were evacuated and more than 20,000 houses were damaged.
The 2013 Balochistan earthquakes took place in late September in southwestern Pakistan. The mainshock had a moment magnitude of 7.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). At least 825 people were killed and hundreds more were injured. On 28 September, a M6.8 aftershock occurred to the north at a depth of 14.8 km, killing at least 22 people.
The 2013 Bohol earthquake occurred on October 15 at 8:12 a.m. (PST) in Bohol, an island province located in Central Visayas, Philippines. The magnitude of the earthquake was recorded at Mw 7.2, with epicenter 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) S 24° W of Sagbayan, and its depth of focus was 12 kilometres (7.5 mi). It affected the whole Central Visayas region, particularly Bohol and Cebu. The quake was felt in the whole Visayas area and as far as Masbate island in the north and Cotabato provinces in southern Mindanao.According to official reports by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), 222 were reported dead, 8 were missing, and 976 people were injured. In all, more than 73,000 structures were damaged, of which more than 14,500 were totally destroyed.It was the deadliest earthquake in the Philippines in 23 years since the 1990 Luzon earthquake. The energy released by the quake was equivalent to 32 Hiroshima bombs.

It struck at 8:25 pm local time (13:55 UTC), and was centered in an isolated area. The estimated depth was 134 km. It lasted for around one minute according to Xinhua reporters.There were no immediate reports of major damage or loss of life as a result of the tremor in Myanmar.The tremor was also felt in Bangladesh and India. In India, at least two people lost their lives and more than 70 were reported to have been injured. 50 people were injured in Chittagong, Bangladesh, rushing out of RMG factories. Some fifty persons suffered injuries in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka and north eastern city of Sylhet as they fled their homes and other buildings during the earthquake. Tremors were also felt in eastern and central Nepal.
A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck India 29 km (18 mi) west of Imphal in the state of Manipur on January 4 with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). At least eleven people were killed, 200 others were injured and numerous buildings were damaged. The quake was also strongly felt in Bangladesh. The earthquake, which hit at 4:35 a.m. on 4 January local time (23:05 UTC, 3 January), was centered in an isolated area. Imphal has a population of more than 250,000.
The 2016 Sumatra earthquake was a 7.8 magnitude earthquake which struck on 2 March 2016 in the Indian Ocean, approximately 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Sumatra in Indonesia. Tsunami warnings were issued for Indonesia and Australia, but were withdrawn two hours later. Heronimus Guru, the National Meteorological Agency's deputy head of operations, initially stated that "there are some who have died", without citing an official death toll; however, it is now known that there were no deaths directly related to the earthquake. Along with the 2016 Ecuador earthquake, which also had a magnitude of 7.8, it is the strongest earthquake yet to strike in the year 2016; however, the earthquake in Ecuador was far more severe, resulting in at least 661 deaths and 27,000 injuries.
At 03:57 local time (19:57 UTC) on February 6, 2016, an earthquake with a moment magnitude of 6.4 struck 28 km (17 mi) northeast of Pingtung City in southern Taiwan, in the Meinong District of Kaohsiung. The earthquake struck at a depth of around 23 km (14 mi). Its comparatively shallow depth caused more intense reverberations on the surface. The earthquake had a maximum intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing widespread damage and 117 deaths. Almost all of the deaths were caused by a collapsed residential building, named Weiguan Jinlong in Yongkang District, except two others, who were killed in Guiren District. Sixty-eight aftershocks have occurred. The earthquake was the deadliest earthquake in Taiwan since the 921 earthquake in 1999.
The 2016 Old Iliamna earthquake struck in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska near Iliamna at 1:30 AM AKST on January 24, 2016. The quake was centered approximately 162 miles (261 km) from Anchorage, and 65 miles (105 km) from Homer. The earthquake registered 7.1, and was felt across a wide area of Southcentral Alaska, the Kenai Peninsula and as far away as Juneau roughly 700 miles (1,100 km) southeast of the epicenter. Moderate to heavy damage to homes, roads and businesses was experienced over a wide area.
The 1605 Nankai earthquake occurred at about 20:00 local time on 3 February. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.9 on the surface wave magnitude scale and triggered a devastating tsunami that resulted in thousands of deaths in the Nankai and Tōkai regions of Japan. It is uncertain whether there were two separate earthquakes separated by a short time interval or a single event. It is referred to as a tsunami earthquake, in that the size of the tsunami greatly exceeds that expected from the magnitude of the earthquake.
The 1620 Robben island earthquake is widely accepted as the oldest recorded earthquake in South African history. It reportedly occurred on 7 April 1620 off Robben Island, with a Mercalli intensity of II–IV (Weak–Light). The event was observed by Augustin de Beaulieu, who was leading a fleet of three ships on Table Bay at the time, who recorded "two startling thunderclaps like cannon shots while ship was becalmed near Robben Island" between 6:00 and 7:00.In 2012, Sharad Master of the South African Journal of Science has disputed the accuracy of the recording of the event, concluding that the thunderclaps were very likely atmospheric phenomena. He argues that it was the slight quake which occurred off Cape Town in 1690 which is actually the oldest recorded one in South Africa which can be verified, of Mercalli intensity III.
The 1621 Panama earthquake, also known as the Panamá Viejo earthquake occurred between 16:30 and 16:45 (UTC−5) on 2 May. It is considered to be the first documented violent quake in the Isthmus of Panama, with the epicenter at Pedro Miguel fault, with a Richter magnitude of about 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The quake shook and partially destroyed the ancient city of Panama (Panama la Vieja), which at that time was a town of about 5,000 inhabitants. It left extensive damage, especially with buildings made of masonry which were partially or fully destroyed.Among the buildings that suffered total collapse were the council, municipal, barracks and prison buildings, and the house of the judge of the Audiencia of Panama. The Convento de la Concepción and the Church of the Society of Jesus also suffered considerable damage, but were only partially rebuilt. The earthquake was preceded by a minor earthquake, which occurred between 9 and 10 am, and a small tsunami was reported by a witness, which flooded a street bordering the coast of Panama city.
The 1622 North Guyuan earthquake struck Ningxia, China on 25 October with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). It was the only recorded big earthquake in western China for 148 years, between 1561 and 1709. The earthquake occurred on the "rake of the Zhongwei-Tongxin fault", with a mid-seismogenic depth of about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi).
The 1625 El Salvador earthquake struck El Salvador in 1625. Described as a "violent earthquake that caused serious damage", it affected the city of San Salvador, and left it in ruins. Surrounding pueblos were also affected.
The 1626 Naples earthquake struck Naples, Italy on July 30. A major earthquake, it killed about 70,000 people in Naples and surrounding villages.
The 1627 Gargano earthquake struck Gargano, southern Italy at about mid-day on 30 July 1627. A "very large earthquake" caused a major tsunami, the largest seismic event ever recorded in the Gargano region, which "produced severe damage in the whole promontory", killing about 5000 people. Four aftershocks were documented. The most extensive damage was noted between San Severo and Lesina.
The 1628 Camarines earthquake struck Camarines, in the Philippines in 1628. Fourteen different shocks were recorded. The date is unknown. The United States' National Geophysical Data Center describes the damage as "severe" and the total number of homes damaged as "many".
The 1629 Banda Sea earthquake struck the Banda Sea, Indonesia on August 1. Its epicentre is believed to have been in the Seram Trough. A "mega-thrust" earthquake caused a 15 m (49 ft) tsunami, which was recorded to have affected the Banda Islands about 30 minutes after the quake. The effects of the tsunami were reported as far as 230 kilometres (140 mi) away in Ambon. Many trees in the Banda Islands were reported to have been uprooted.
The 1630 Crete earthquake reportedly occurred at around 09:00 on 9 March 1630 in the Kythira Strait, off the coast of Crete. Until the mid 1990s, the earthquake had traditionally been referred to as the 1629 Crete earthquake, which had been documented to have occurred at about 10:00 on Saturday 27 February 1629. Extensive research by several experts on the subject since the late 1980s has revealed that a calculation error mis-dated the occurrence by several days and a year.
The 1638 New Hampshire earthquake struck central New England on June 1 (Julian calendar). It was the first major earthquake in New England after the start of European colonization. Modern analysis places its epicenter somewhere near central New Hampshire, and it probably measured between magnitude 6.5 and 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, making it the strongest earthquake on record in New Hampshire and one of the strongest in the region's history (the 1663 Charlevoix earthquake was probably stronger).
The 1641 Caracas earthquake took place in Venezuela on 11 June 1641. It is often known as the San Bernabé earthquake because 11 June is the feast day of Barnabas in the Catholic calendar. The earthquake caused extensive damage in Caracas and the destruction of La Guaira; the event led the Caracas city council to propose rebuilding its city in what was then the savannah of Chacao, a move that was opposed by the Governor, Ruy Fernández de Fuenmayor.
The 1645 Luzon earthquake was one of the most destructive earthquakes to hit the Philippines. It occurred on November 30 at about 08:00 PM local time on Luzon Island in the northern part of the country. The island was struck by a 7.5 Ms (surface wave magnitude) tremor produced by the San Manuel and Gabaldon Faults (Nueva Ecija) in the central section of the island.Aftershocks continued a few days after the quake then on December 4, 1645, at 11:00 pm, a strong earthquake allegedly equal or stronger than the November 30 shaking hit the same area, causing further death and destruction.
The 1647 Santiago earthquake struck Santiago, Chile on the night of 13 May (22:30 local time, 02:30 UTC on 14 May) and is said to have brought virtually every building in the city to the ground. The earthquake was felt throughout the so-called Captaincy General of Chile, an administrative territory of the Spanish Empire. The maximum felt intensity was XI on the Mercalli intensity scale and there were about a thousand casualties.
The 1653 East Smyrna earthquake occurred on 23 February, with an estimated magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1663 Charlevoix earthquake occurred on February 5 in New France (now the Canadian province of Quebec), and was assessed to have a moment magnitude of between 7.3 and 7.9. The earthquake occurred at 5:30 p.m. local time and was estimated to have a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The main shock epicentre is suggested to have occurred along the Saint Lawrence River, between the mouth of the Malbaie River on the north and the mouth of the Ouelle River on the south. A large portion of eastern North America felt the effects. Landslides and underwater sediment slumps were a primary characteristic of the event with much of the destruction occurring near the epicentral region of the St. Lawrence estuary and also in the area of the Saguenay Graben.The event occurred during the early European settlement of North America and some of the best recorded first hand accounts were from Catholic missionaries that were working in the area. These records were scrutinized to help determine the scale of damage and estimate the magnitude of the quake in the absence of abundant records from that time period.
The earthquake in Dubrovnik in 1667 was one of the two most devastating earthquakes to hit the area of modern Croatia in the last 2,400 years, since records began. The entire city was almost destroyed and around 5,000 people were killed. The city's Rector Simone Ghetaldi was killed and over three quarters of all public buildings were destroyed. At the time, Dubrovnik was the capital of the Republic of Ragusa. The earthquake marked the beginning of the end of the Republic.
The 1667 Shamakhi earthquake occurred in November 1667 with an epicenter close to the city of Şamaxı, Azerbaijan. It had an estimated surface wave magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. An estimated 80,000 people died.
The 1679 Armenia earthquake (also called Yerevan earthquake or Garni earthquake) took place on June 4 in the Yerevan region of Armenia, then part of the Persian Empire).Numerous buildings were destroyed as a result of the earthquake. In Yerevan (Erivan) most notable structures were damaged. The Erivan Fortress was destroyed completely, so were the following churches: Poghos-Petros, Katoghike, Zoravor and the Gethsemane Chapel.Furthermore, the nearby Kanaker village was completely destroyed. The classical Hellenistic Temple of Garni also collapsed. Among many churches and monasteries that were reduced to ruins were Havuts Tar, Saint Sargis Monastery of Ushi, Hovhannavank, Geghard, and Khor Virap.
The 1687 Peru earthquake occurred at 11:30 UTC on October 20. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.4–8.7 and caused severe damage to Lima, Callao and Ica. It triggered a tsunami and overall about 5,000 people died.
The 1688 Smyrna earthquake occurred at 11:45 on 10 July. It had an epicenter close to Izmir, Turkey. It had an estimated surface wave magnitude of 7.0, with a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and caused about 16,000 casualties.
The 1692 Jamaica earthquake struck Port Royal, Jamaica on June 7. A stopped pocket watch found in the harbour in 1969 indicated that it occurred around 11:43 a.m. Port Royal was then the unofficial capital of Jamaica, and one of the busiest and wealthiest ports in the West Indies. It was known both as the "storehouse and treasury of the West Indies" and "one of the wickedest places on earth", being a common home port for the many privateers and pirates operating within the Caribbean Sea. The earthquake caused most of the city to sink below sea level and about 2,000 people died as a result of the earthquake and the following tsunami. About 3,000 people died in the days following the earthquakes due to injuries and disease.
The 1692 Salta earthquake took place in the Province of Salta, in the Republic of Argentina on 13 September at 11:00 a.m. local time. It registered 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale and was located at a depth of 30 kilometres (19 mi). Aftershocks continued to be felt until 15 September.
The 1693 Sicily earthquake struck parts of southern Italy near Sicily, Calabria and Malta on January 11 at around 9 pm local time. This earthquake was preceded by a damaging foreshock on January 9. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale, the most powerful in Italian history, and a maximum intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, destroying at least 70 towns and cities, seriously affecting an area of 5,600 square kilometres (2,200 sq mi) and causing the death of about 60,000 people. The earthquake was followed by tsunamis that devastated the coastal villages on the Ionian Sea and in the Straits of Messina. Almost two thirds of the entire population of Catania were killed. The epicentre of the disaster was probably close to the coast, possibly offshore, although the exact position remains unknown. The extent and degree of destruction caused by the earthquake resulted in extensive rebuilding of the towns and cities of southeastern Sicily, particularly the Val di Noto, in a homogeneous late Baroque style, described as "the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe".According to a contemporary account of the earthquake by Vincentius Bonajutus, published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, "It was in this country impossible to keep upon our legs, or in one place on the dancing Earth; nay, those that lay along on the ground, were tossed from side to side, as if on a rolling billow."
The 1694 Irpinia–Basilicata earthquake occurred on 8 September. It caused widespread damage in the Basilicata and Apulia regions of what was then the Kingdom of Naples, resulting in more than 6,000 casualties. The earthquake occurred at 11:40 UTC and lasted between 30 and 60 seconds.
The 1700 Cascadia earthquake occurred along the Cascadia subduction zone on January 26 with an estimated moment magnitude of 8.7–9.2. The megathrust earthquake involved the Juan de Fuca Plate that underlies the Pacific Ocean, from mid-Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, south along the Pacific Northwest coast as far as northern California. The length of the fault rupture was about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) with an average slip of 20 meters (66 ft).The earthquake caused a tsunami that struck the coast of Japan, and may also be linked to the Bonneville Slide and the Tseax Cone eruption in British Columbia.
The 1703 Apennine earthquakes were a sequence of three earthquakes of magnitude ≥6 that occurred in the central Apennines of Italy, over a period of 19 days. The epicenters were near Norcia (14 January), Montereale (16 January) and L'Aquila (2 February), showing a southwards progression over about 36 km. These events involved all of the known active faults between Norcia and L'Aquila. A total of about 10,000 people are estimated to have died as a result of these earthquakes, although because of the overlap in areas affected by the three events, casualty numbers remain highly uncertain.
The 1703 Genroku earthquake (元禄大地震, Genroku Daijishin) occurred at 02:00 local time on December 31 (17:00 December 30 UTC). The epicenter was near Edo, the forerunner of present-day Tokyo, in the southern part of the Kantō Region, Japan. An estimated 2,300 people were killed by the shaking and subsequent fires. The earthquake triggered a major tsunami which caused many casualties, giving a total death toll of at least 5,233, possibly up to 10,000. Genroku is a Japanese era spanning from 1688 through 1704.
The 1717 Guatemala earthquake struck Guatemala on September 29 with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.4, and a Mercalli intensity of approximately IX (Violent). The earthquake essentially destroyed much of the architecture of Antigua Guatemala, which was the colonial capital of Central America at the time. Over 3,000 buildings were ruined including many temples and churches. Such was the effect of the disaster that the authorities considered moving the headquarters to a settlement which was less prone to natural disasters.Later earthquakes meant that after the 1773 earthquake the town had been moved three times. In 1776, after the Santa Marta earthquakes, the Spanish Crown finally ordered the capital to be moved to a safer location, in the Valley of the Shrine, where Guatemala City, the modern capital of Guatemala, now stands.
The 1727 Tabriz earthquake occurred on 18 November with an epicenter near Tabriz in northwest Iran. The maximum felt intensity was VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and there were an estimated 77,000 deaths. It is possible that the information for this earthquake refers to the 1721 Tabriz earthquake instead.
The 1732 Montreal earthquake was a 5.8 magnitude earthquake that struck New France at 11:00 a.m. on September 16. The shaking associated with this earthquake shook the city of Montreal with significant damage, including destroyed chimneys, cracked walls and 300 damaged houses, as well as 185 buildings destroyed by fire following the earthquake. A girl was reported killed from the seismic activity, although Gabriel Leblanc found present information could not substantiate the claim, especially since, if the death was true, it should have been but was not mentioned in the description of the natural disaster by Sister Cuillerier, a staff member of the Hotel Dieu Hospital.The 1732 Montreal earthquake is one of the major earthquakes that occurred in the Western Quebec Seismic Zone.
Three earthquakes, which occurred off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia and the Soviet Union in 1737, 1923 and 1952, were megathrust earthquakes and caused tsunamis. They occurred where the Pacific Plate subducts under the Okhotsk Plate at the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench. The depth of the trench at the point of the earthquakes is 7,000–7,500 m. Northern Kamchatka lies at the western end of the Bering fault, between the Pacific Plate and North American Plate, or the Bering plate There are many more earthquakes and tsunamis originating from Kamchatka, of which the most recent was the 1997 Kamchatka earthquake and tsunami originating near the Kronotsky Peninsula.
The 1746 Lima–Callao earthquake occurred at 22:30 local time on 28 October with a moment magnitude of 8.6–8.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The epicenter was located about 90 km (56 mi) north-northwest of the capital Lima, which was almost completely destroyed, and the subsequent tsunami devastated the port city of Callao. It was the deadliest earthquake in Peru’s history prior to the 1970 earthquake.
The 1751 Concepción earthquake was one of the strongest and most destructive recorded quakes in Chilean history. It struck the Central Valley of the country, destroying the cities of Concepción, Chillán, Cauquenes, Curicó and Talca, probably on May 24, 1751, although there is currently a debate among scholars as to the exact date of the earthquake (see also "Other dates").
The 1751 Port-au-Prince earthquake occurred at 12:50 UTC on 21 November in French Haiti, followed by a sea wave. Another earthquake was reported at the same location on 15 September of the same year and it is uncertain whether the two reports refer to the same event.
The 1755 Cape Ann earthquake took place off the coast of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay (present-day Massachusetts) on November 18. At between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, it remains the largest earthquake in the history of Massachusetts. No one was killed, but it damaged hundreds of buildings in Boston and was felt as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina. Sailors on a ship more than 200 miles (320 km) offshore felt the quake, and mistook it at first for their ship running aground. Many residents of Boston and the surrounding areas attributed the quake to God, and it occasioned a brief increase in religious fervor in the city. Modern studies estimate that if a similar quake shook Boston today, it would result in as much as $5 billion in damage and hundreds of deaths.It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not enough evidence to prove that they are linked.
The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, also known as the Great Lisbon earthquake, occurred in the Kingdom of Portugal on Saturday, 1 November, the holiday of All Saints' Day, at around 09:40 local time. In combination with subsequent fires and a tsunami (maremoto in Portuguese), the earthquake almost totally destroyed Lisbon and adjoining areas. Seismologists today estimate the Lisbon earthquake had a magnitude in the range 8.5–9.0 on the moment magnitude scale, with its epicentre in the Atlantic Ocean about 200 km (120 mi) west-southwest of Cape St. Vincent. Estimates place the death toll in Lisbon alone between 10,000 and 100,000 people, making it one of the deadliest earthquakes in history.The earthquake accentuated political tensions in the Kingdom of Portugal and profoundly disrupted the country's colonial ambitions. The event was widely discussed and dwelt upon by European Enlightenment philosophers, and inspired major developments in theodicy. As the first earthquake studied scientifically for its effects over a large area, it led to the birth of modern seismology and earthquake engineering.
The Near East earthquakes of 1759 was a series of devastating earthquakes that shook a large portion of the Levant in October and November of that year. This geographical crossroads in the Eastern Mediterranean includes portions of Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Israel. The ruins of Baalbek, a settlement in the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon east of the Litani River, were badly damaged. These events, along with the earlier 1202 Syria earthquake, are likely the strongest historical earthquakes in the region.
The 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake took place at 7:15 pm on June 3, on the Enriquillo fault near Port-au-Prince, Saint-Domingue, the French colony that is now the country of Haiti.The earthquake was strong enough to destroy Port-au-Prince, and leveled all the buildings between Lake Miragoâne and Petit-Goâve, to the west of Port-au-Prince. The Plain of the Cul-de-Sac, a rift valley under Port-au-Prince that extends eastwards into the Dominican Republic, experienced extensive soil liquefaction. The ground under Port-au-Prince liquefied, throwing down all its buildings, including those that had survived the 1751 earthquake. One village, Croix des Bouquets, sank below sea level. Strong shocks were felt in Cap-Haïtien, about 160 kilometres (99 mi) away from the estimated epicenter in the Léogâne Arrondissement. Some chimneys on the distant island of Jamaica collapsed. The earthquake generated a tsunami that came ashore along the Gulf of Gonâve, and rolled as much as 7.2 kilometres (4.5 mi) inland into the Cul-de-Sac depression, though this might have been confounded with the effects of the liquefaction.It is estimated that 200 people died in Port-au-Prince in collapsed buildings, including 79 of the 80 people in Port-au-Prince's hospital. The death toll would have been higher, but the earthquake was preceded by a rumbling noise that gave people time to flee their houses before the main tremor, which consisted of two shocks lasting a total of four minutes. Fifty people died in Léogâne. The aftermath of the earthquake saw much more death as thousands of slaves escaped in the chaos, the local economy collapsed and 15,000 slaves died in the subsequent famine. An additional 15,000 people died from what is thought to have been gastrointestinal anthrax from eating tainted meat bought from Spanish traders.
The 1773 Guatemala earthquake struck Guatemala on July 29 and had an estimated epicentral magnitude of 7.5 Mi. It was followed by numerous aftershocks which lasted until December 1773. The series of all these earthquakes is also referred to as the Santa Marta earthquake(s) as it had started on the feast day of Saint Martha.With an intensity of approximately VII (Very strong) to VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, the Santa Marta earthquakes destroyed much of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (modern Antigua Guatemala), which was at that time the colonial capital of Central America. About 500 - 600 people died immediately and at least another 600 died from starvation and disease as a result of the earthquake. The event had significant impact on the number of religious personnel in the area, especially the Mercedarian Order, with the count reduced almost by half and a similar reduction in the amount of income received.
The 1782 Mendoza earthquake took place in the province of Mendoza, Argentina, on 22 May 1782, at about 4 PM (UTC-3). It had an estimated magnitude of 7.0 in the Richter scale. Its epicenter was at 33°0′S 69°12′W, at a depth of 30 km.This was the first earthquake of many which would affect the provincial capital, Mendoza, since its foundation. It was felt with grade VIII in the Mercalli intensity scale, and damaged several buildings, but did not produce casualties.
The 1783 Calabrian earthquakes were a sequence of five strong earthquakes that hit the region of Calabria in southern Italy (then part of the Kingdom of Naples), the first two of which produced significant tsunamis. The epicenters form a clear alignment extending nearly 100 km from the Straits of Messina to about 18 km SSW of Catanzaro. The epicenter of the first earthquake occurred in the plain of Palmi. The earthquakes occurred over a period of nearly two months, all with estimated magnitudes of 5.9 or greater. Estimates of the total number of deaths lie in the range 32,000 to 50,000.
The 1783 New Jersey earthquake occurred on November 29 in the Province of New Jersey. Measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale, it stands as the most powerful earthquake to occur in the state.
The 1787 Mexico earthquake, also known as the San Sixto earthquake, occurred on 28 March at 11:30 local time (17:30 UTC). It caused a large tsunami that affected the coast of the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca in Southwestern Mexico. With an estimated magnitude of 8.6 on the moment magnitude scale it was more powerful than any instrumentally recorded Mexican earthquake.
The 1787 Boricua earthquake struck the island of Puerto Rico on May 2. The magnitude of the earthquake is believed to have been of 8.0–8.5; however, that might not be an exact number. The epicenter is thought to have been somewhere north of Puerto Rico, probably on the Puerto Rico Trench. Puerto Rican geomorphologist José Molinelli considers it "the strongest" in the seismic history of the country.
The 1792 Unzen earthquake and tsunami resulted from the volcanic activities of Mount Unzen (in the Shimabara Peninsula of Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan) on 21 May. This caused the collapse of the southern flank of the Mayuyama dome in front of Mount Unzen, resulting in a tremendous tsunami, killing 15,000 people altogether. It was also called, Shimabara erupted, Higo affected (島原大変肥後迷惑), (Shimabara means the central mountain of the Shimabara Peninsula) since many people were killed by this tsunami in Higo (Kumamoto Prefecture, situated 20 km away across the Ariake Sea).
The 1797 Riobamba earthquake occurred at 12:30 UTC on 4 February. It devastated the city of Riobamba and many other cities in the Interandean valley, causing up to 40,000 casualties. It is estimated that seismic intensities in the epicentral area reached at least XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and that the earthquake had a magnitude of 8.3, the most powerful historical event known in Ecuador. The earthquake was studied by Alexander von Humboldt, when he visited the area in 1801/2.
The 1797 Sumatra earthquake was the first in a series of great earthquakes that ruptured part of the Sumatran segment of the Sunda megathrust. It caused a damaging tsunami that was particularly severe near Padang, where a 150–200 ton English ship was driven 1 km inland up the Arau River.
The 1802 Vrancea earthquake occurred on 26 October [O.S. 14 October] 1802 during St. Paraskeva's celebrated Day. Its magnitude is estimated at 7.9 on the moment magnitude scale making it the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Romania and one of the strongest earthquakes in European history. It was felt from Saint Petersburg to Greek islands in the Aegean Sea, and from Belgrade to Moscow. Its felt area (more that 2 million square kilometers) places it among the largest earthquakes known on the interior of the Eurasian continent. According to local witnesses, "in many localities in Burzenland (Romanian: Țara Bârsei) were formed huge holes in the ground, cracks, wide crevices of several feet (1 foot = 33 cm) and many fathoms deep, partially filled with water".In Bucharest, many church steeples fell, and Turnul Colței broke in half, killing an itinerant merchant. The earthquake was felt in Bucharest with an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on Mercalli scale. Likewise, Cotroceni Monastery completely collapsed. Numerous fires broke out, caused mainly by overthrowing stoves. In Focșani, wall of St. John Monastery fell. Also, several households and church steeples collapsed following the first oscillations of the soil.In Moscow, some walls were cracked, suspended objects swung. In many other cities in Russia and Ukraine, soil oscillated for several minutes. Significant damage was caused in other areas of Ukraine, in Lviv and even Kiev. The earthquake caused fear in Warsaw (Poland), and in Bulgaria, the cities of Ruse, Varna and Vidin were almost completely destroyed.The Great Earthquake (Romanian: Cutremurul cel Mare), as the Bucharest inhabitants of 19th century called this sinister event, coincided with the ascent to the throne of Prince Constantin Ipsilanti, surprised by the earthquake in the commune of Radovanu (Călărași County). He prayed for the salvation of his submissives. An engraving print shows that roofs and chimneys of houses flied, walls fell, and people tried to run scared and couldn't keep up. The Chronicle of the craftsman Ioan Dobrescu (1802–30) mentions that "the earth here and there opened a whole as if a man with a horse could enter in it (...) and through the cracks of the earth appeared water with black clay which smelt badly like brimstone". Such a description of the disaster caused by this earthquake in Bucharest appears in the record made in the Cyrillic alphabet on the book Pentecostarion: "ground cracked and appeared water with sand".
The 1805 Molise earthquake occurred on July 26 at 21:01 UTC. It has an estimated magnitude of 6.6 on the equivalent magnitude scale (Me) (calculated from seismic intensity data) and a maximum perceived intensity of X on the Mercalli intensity scale. The area of greatest damage was between the towns of Isernia and Campobasso, while the area of intense damage extended over about 2,000 square kilometres. There were an estimated 5,573 deaths resulting from this earthquake and two of the aftershocks.
The 1810 Crete earthquake occurred at 22:15 on 16 February. It caused great destruction in Heraklion, some damage from Malta to northern Egypt and was felt from central Italy to Syria. 2,000 fatalities were reported from Candia (Heraklion).
The 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes were an intense intraplate earthquake series beginning with an initial earthquake of moment magnitude 7.5‑7.9 on December 16, 1811 followed by a moment magnitude 7.4 aftershock on the same day. They remain the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Mountains in recorded history. They, as well as the seismic zone of their occurrence, were named for the Mississippi River town of New Madrid, then part of the Louisiana Territory, now within Missouri.There are estimates that these stable continental region earthquakes were felt strongly over roughly 130,000 square kilometers (50,000 sq mi), and moderately across nearly 3 million square kilometers (1 million square miles). The 1906 San Francisco earthquake, by comparison, was felt moderately over roughly 16,000 km2 (6,200 sq mi).
The 1812 Caracas earthquake took place in Venezuela on March 26 (on Maundy Thursday) at 4:37 p.m. It measured 7.7 on the Richter magnitude scale. It caused extensive damage in Caracas, La Guaira, Barquisimeto, San Felipe, and Mérida. An estimated 15,000-20,000 people perished as a result, in addition to incalculable material damage.The seismic movement was so drastic that in a zone named Valecillo a new lake was formed and the river Yurubí was dammed up. Numerous rivulets changed their course in the valley of Caracas, which was flooded with dirty water.Based on contemporary descriptions, the earthquake is believed to have consisted of two seismic shocks occurring within the span of 30 minutes. The first destroyed Caracas and the second Mérida, where it was raining when the shock occurred.
The 1812 Wrightwood earthquake, also known as the San Juan Capistrano earthquake, occurred on December 8 in Southern California 7:00 AM (Pacific time). It is thought to be the result of a rupture of the southern segment of the San Andreas Fault for an estimated length of 170 kilometers (110 mi) near Wrightwood, California, though the epicenter's location is not precisely known, and other proposed sources for the event exist. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1817 Santiago del Estero earthquake took place in the province of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, on 4 July at about 05:30 PM. It was estimated to be 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. Its epicenter was at 28°00′S 64°30′W, at a depth of 30 km.The earthquake was felt with grade VIII in the Mercalli intensity scale in the provincial capital Santiago del Estero, where it caused grave damage.
The 1819 Rann of Kutch earthquake occurred at about 18:45 to 18:50 local time on 16 June. It had an estimated magnitude ranging from 7.7 to 8.2 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a tsunami and caused at least 1,543 deaths. The earthquake caused an area of subsidence to that formed the Sindri Lake and a local zone of uplift to the north about 80 km long, 6 km wide and 6 m high that dammed the Koree / Kori / Puram river. This natural dam was known as the Allah Bund ("Dam of God").
The 1833 Sumatra earthquake occurred on November 25 at about 22:00 local time, with an estimated magnitude in the range of 8.8–9.2 Mw. It caused a large tsunami that flooded the southwestern coast of the island. There are no reliable records of the loss of life, with the casualties being described only as 'numerous'. The magnitude of this event has been estimated using records of uplift taken from coral microatolls.
The 1834 Jerusalem earthquake occurred on 13 May 1834 during the first few days of the Peasants' Revolt in Palestine against Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt. The earthquake's epicenter was in the Jerusalem area. After a brief lull, fighting resumed the next day.Damage from the quake included the collapse of part of the city wall near the Dome of the Rock, the collapse of the dome over the Chapel of the Ascension, a minaret in the city and one on the Mount of Olives, the collapse or damage of several large Jerusalem homes, and the severe damage of Latin and Armenian monasteries in Bethlehem. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre suffered minor damage.
The 1835 Concepción earthquake occurred near the neighboring cities of Concepción and Talcahuano in Chile on February 20 at 11:30 local time (15:30 UTC) and has an estimated magnitude of 8.2 Mfa or 8.1 Ml. The earthquake triggered a tsunami which caused the destruction of Talcahuano. A total of at least 50 people died from the effects of the earthquake and the tsunami. The earthquake caused damage from San Fernando in the north to Osorno in the south. It was felt over a still wider area from Copiapó in the north to the island of Chiloe in the south and as far west as the Juan Fernández Islands.
The Galilee earthquake of 1837, often called the Safed earthquake, shook the Galilee on January 1 and is one of a number of moderate to large events that have occurred along the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system that marks the boundary of two tectonic plates; the African Plate on the west and the Arabian Plate on the east. Intensity assessments for the event were VIII (Damaging) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale and VIII (Heavily damaging) on the European Macroseismic Scale.A 1977 assessment of the event that was published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America had the epicenter just north of the city of Safed and the magnitude of 6.25–6.5, but in 1997 seismologist Nicholas Ambraseys argued that the event may have been more substantial. The event was well-documented by the nineteenth-century missionary, archaeologist, and author William McClure Thomson. The region in which the earthquake occurred was part of the Ottoman empire but at the time it was under control of the Egyptians who were occupying after seizing it during conflict.
The 1838 Vrancea earthquake struck the western part of Vrancea County on 23 January (O.S. 11 January) with a magnitude of 7.5. The seism caused extensive damage in Moldavia and Wallachia, and killed dozens of people. The earthquake occurred just 36 years after another earthquake of magnitude over 7 on Richter scale devastated the southern part of Romanian Principalities.The earthquake occurred at 20:45, being felt strongly in Bucharest and also all over the country up to Lviv, Sevastopol, Constantinople (Istanbul), Odessa, etc. A detailed report on the phenomenon was promptly done by Güstav Schuller, mining geologist in the service of the Duke of Saxony. He said the quake had a foreshock followed by three strong shocks.During this earthquake, in some areas, especially the epicentral zone, mainly in Vrancea, Buzău, Brăila and Dâmbovița counties appeared large ground cracks and liquefaction phenomena.
The 1842 Cap-Haïtien earthquake occurred at 17:00 local time (21:00 UTC) on 7 May. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale and triggered a destructive tsunami. It badly affected the northern coast of Haiti and part of what is now the Dominican Republic. Port-de-Paix suffered the greatest damage from both earthquake and tsunami. Approximately 5,000 people were killed by the effects of the earthquake shaking and another 300 by the tsunami.
The 1843 Wanganui earthquake occurred on 8 July at 16:45 local time with an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale. The maximum perceived intensity was IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale' possibly reaching X (Extreme). The epicentre is estimated to have been within a zone extending 50 km northeast from Wanganui towards Taihape. GNS Science has this earthquake cataloged and places the epicenter 35 km east of Taihape, near the border of Hawke's Bay. This was the first earthquake in New Zealand over magnitude 7 for which written records exist, and the first for which deaths were recorded.
The 1848 Marlborough earthquake is the name associated with a severe earthquake which occurred at 1:40 a.m. on 16 October 1848 and whose epicenter was in the Marlborough region of the South Island of New Zealand.In Wellington the shaking lasted for about two minutes and caused widespread damage, especially to brick- or stone- built structures. Most of the buildings damaged in the earthquake were rebuilt in wood and this contributed to the relatively low level of damage and loss of life in the more powerful Wairarapa earthquake that hit Wellington seven years later.
The 1854 Nankai earthquake occurred at about 16:00 local time on 24 December. It had a magnitude of 8.4 and caused a damaging tsunami. More than 30,000 buildings were completely destroyed and there were at least 3,000 casualties.It was the second of the three Ansei great earthquakes; the 1854 Tōkai earthquake of similar size had hit the area the previous morning.
The 1854 Tōkai earthquake was the first of the Ansei great earthquakes (1854–1855). It occurred at about 09:00 local time on 23 December 1854. It had a magnitude of 8.4 and caused a damaging tsunami. More than 10,000 buildings were destroyed and there were at least 2,000 casualties.It was the first of the three Ansei great earthquakes; the 1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake of similar size hit southern Honshu the following day.
The 1855 Edo earthquake (安政江戸地震, Ansei Edo Jishin), also known as the Great Ansei earthquake, was one of the major disasters of the late-Edo period. The earthquake occurred at 22:00 local time on 11 November. It had an epicenter close to Edo (now Tokyo), causing considerable damage in the Kantō region from the shaking and subsequent fires, with a death toll of about 7,000 people. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale and reached a maximum intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake triggered a minor tsunami.
The 1855 Bursa earthquake occurred on 28 February, with a recorded magnitude of 7.5. A devastating precursor quake that took place in Kemalpaşa, a town of Bursa, Turkey caused severe destruction all over Bursa and other neighboring cities. 300 people died and thousands of homes and workplaces were wrecked, and some of the historical monuments and buildings including mosques collapsed. Subsequently, fire spread out in the city, which increased the death toll.On 11 April 1855, an aftershock of the 28 February earthquake was recorded as 7.0 magnitude. This aftershock affected the region from Gemlik to Mudanya. 1,300 people died. Gökmen-zâde Seyyid el-Hâcî Hüseyin Rıfat Efendî Bursavî wrote about these earthquakes in his book İşaret-numa, written in the Ottoman Turkish language.
The 1855 Wairarapa earthquake occurred on 23 January at about 9 p.m., affecting much of the Cook Strait area of New Zealand, including Marlborough in the South Island and Wellington and Wairarapa in the North Island. In Wellington, close to the epicenter, shaking lasted for at least 50 seconds. The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to have been in the range 8.2–8.3, the most powerful recorded in New Zealand since systematic European colonisation began in 1840. This earthquake was associated with the largest observed movement on a strike-slip fault, maximum 18 metres (59 ft). It has been suggested that the surface rupture formed by this event helped influence Charles Lyell to link earthquakes with rapid movement on faults.
The 1856 Djijelli earthquakes occurred on August 21 and 22 near the coastal area of northern Algeria. The magnitude of the two shocks are unknown, but each had a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent) and each was followed by a tsunami that affected the Mediterranean Sea. These high intensity shocks were felt as far as Genoa in northern Italy. Three people were killed as a result of the second event.
The 1857 Basilicata earthquake (also known as the Great Neapolitan earthquake) occurred on December 16 in the Basilicata region of Italy southeast of the city of Naples. The epicentre was in Montemurro, on the western border of the modern province of Potenza. Several towns were destroyed, and estimated fatalities were around 10,000. At the time it was the third largest known earthquake, and has been estimated to have been of magnitude 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake occurred at about 8:20 am (Pacific time) on January 9, 1857, in central and Southern California. With an estimated moment magnitude of 7.9, it ruptured the southern part of the San Andreas Fault for a length of about 225 miles (350 kilometers), between Parkfield and Wrightwood. The earthquake was felt throughout much of California, as far north as the city of Marysville and as far south as the mouth of the Colorado River at the Gulf of California in Mexico, and as far east as Las Vegas, Nevada.Though the shock was centered near Parkfield, the event is referred to as the Fort Tejon earthquake, because that was the location of the greatest damage. Fort Tejon is just north of the junction of the San Andreas and Garlock Faults, where the Tehachapi, San Emigdio, and Sierra Pelona Transverse Ranges come together.The earthquake was the last large event to occur along that portion of the San Andreas Fault, and was estimated to have a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Modified Mercalli scale (MM) near Fort Tejon in the Tehachapi Mountains, and along the San Andreas Fault from Mil Potrero (near Pine Mountain Club) in the San Emigdio Mountains to Lake Hughes in the Sierra Pelona Mountains. Accounts of the events' effects varied widely, including the time of the main shock as well as foreshocks that were reported to have occurred at several locations earlier that morning.
The Hietsu earthquake (飛越地震, Hietsu jishin) took place on April 9, 1858 (according to the old Japanese calendar, February 26, Ansei 5). It occurred on the Atotsugawa Fault, which connects the Amō Pass in Gifu Prefecture (in the part that was called Hida Province) and Mount Tate in Toyama Prefecture (then known as Etchū Province) on the island of Honshū in Japan. Its name includes one kanji from Hida (飛騨国) and one from Etchū (越中国). The earthquake is estimated to have killed 200–300 people. It also caused the Mount Tombi Landslide and blocked the upper reaches of the Jōganji River.
The 1859 Shamakhi earthquake struck Shamakhi in the Baku Governorate region of Azerbaijan, which was at the time part of the Russian Empire, on 11 June. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 5.9 and caused moderate damage and killed approximately 100 people.
The 1859 Erzurum earthquake occurred at 10:30 on 2 June. It had a magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum intensity of IX on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 15,000 casualties.
The 1861 Mendoza earthquake occurred in the province of Mendoza, Argentina on 20 March at 11:30 PM. It had a magnitude of 7.2 on the Surface wave magnitude scale and an intensity of IX in the Mercalli scale. Its hypocenter was located at an estimated depth of 30 kilometres (19 mi).The earthquake devastated the provincial capital, Mendoza, killing 4,300 of its 12,000 residents and injuring 750. [1] Most of the buildings were destroyed, including the cabildo (colonial government house). The town was rebuilt in a nearby location, and the authorities moved to their new seat in 1863. The new constructions, which incorporated modern architectural tendencies, were markedly different from the old colonial buildings.
The 1861 Sumatra earthquake occurred on February 16 and was the last in a sequences of earthquakes that ruptured adjacent parts of the Sumatran segment of the Sunda megathrust. It caused a devastating tsunami which led to several thousand fatalities. The earthquake was felt as far away as the Malay peninsula and the eastern part of Java. The rupture area for the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake is similar to that estimated for the 1861 event.
The 1863 Hawke's Bay earthquake was a devastating earthquake that struck near the town of Waipukurau on February 23, 1863. It remained the single largest earthquake to strike Hawke's Bay until 1931, where a 7.8 magnitude quake leveled much of Napier and Hastings and killed 256 people.
The 1863 Jujuy earthquake took place in the province of Jujuy, Argentina on 14 January at about 11:00 (UTC). It had an estimated magnitude of 6.4 and its epicenter was at 23°36′S 65°00′W, at a depth of about 50 kilometres (31 mi).This earthquake had a felt intensity of VIII on the Mercalli intensity scale. Its magnitude and duration made it exceptionally destructive, causing damage to the cathedral, the cabildo (colonial government house) and precarious homes in San Salvador de Jujuy, the provincial capital.
The 1865 Memphis earthquake struck southwest Tennessee near the Mississippi River in the United States on August 17 that year. Soon after the magnitude 5.0 earthquake hit, observers said the earth appeared to undulate and waves formed in nearby rivers. The force of the earthquake felled and cracked chimneys in Memphis and New Madrid, Missouri on the other side of the Mississippi. Shaking from the earthquake spread as far as St. Louis, Missouri; Jackson, Mississippi; and Illinois. Apart from the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes, only three major events have struck the state of Tennessee, in 1843, 1865, and 1895. Several minor events have taken place as well.
The 1867 Manhattan earthquake struck Riley County, Kansas on April 24 at 14:22 local time. It measured 5.1 on a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or the event's felt area. The earthquake's epicenter was by the town of Manhattan and is the strongest earthquake to originate in the state.The earthquake had an intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and was felt over an area of roughly 193,051 square miles (500,000 km2). It caused largely minor damage, reports of which were confined to Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri, according to the United States Geological Survey.Manhattan is near the Nemaha Ridge, a long structure that is bounded by several faults. The nearby Humboldt Fault Zone in particular poses a threat to the city; though Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, an earthquake could occur at any time.
An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the perceptible shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can be violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The seismicity or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time.Earthquakes are measured using observations from seismometers. The moment magnitude is the most common scale on which earthquakes larger than approximately 5 are reported for the entire globe. The more numerous earthquakes smaller than magnitude 5 reported by national seismological observatories are measured mostly on the local magnitude scale, also referred to as the Richter magnitude scale. These two scales are numerically similar over their range of validity. Magnitude 3 or lower earthquakes are mostly imperceptible or weak and magnitude 7 and over potentially cause serious damage over larger areas, depending on their depth. The largest earthquakes in historic times have been of magnitude slightly over 9, although there is no limit to the possible magnitude. Intensity of shaking is measured on the modified Mercalli scale. The shallower an earthquake, the more damage to structures it causes, all else being equal.At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and sometimes displacement of the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, and occasionally volcanic activity.In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event — whether natural or caused by humans — that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.
1868 (MDCCCLXVIII) was a leap year starting on Wednesday (dominical letter ED) of the Gregorian calendar and a leap year starting on Monday (dominical letter GF) of the Julian calendar, the 1868th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 868th year of the 2nd millennium, the 68th year of the 19th century, and the 9th year of the 1860s decade. Note that the Julian day for 1868 is 12 calendar days difference, which continued to be used from 1582 until the complete conversion of the Gregorian calendar was entirely done in 1929.
The 1868 Arica earthquake occurred on 13 August 1868, near Arica, then part of Peru, now part of Chile, at 21:30 UTC. It had an estimated magnitude between 8.5 and 9.0. A tsunami (or multiple tsunamis) in the Pacific Ocean was produced by the earthquake, which was recorded in Hawaii, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.
The 1868 Ecuador earthquakes occurred at 19:30 UTC on August 15 and 06:30 UTC on 16 August 1868. They caused severe damage in the northeastern part of Ecuador and in southwestern Colombia. They had an estimated magnitude of 6.3 and 6.7 and together caused up to 70,000 casualties. The earthquake of 15 August occurred near El Ángel, Carchi Province, close to the border with Colombia, while that of August 16 occurred near Ibarra in Imbabura Province. Reports of these earthquakes are often confused with the effects of the earthquake of 13 August at Arica.
The 1868 Hawaii earthquake was the largest recorded in the history of Hawaiʻi island, with an estimated magnitude of 7.9 on the Richter scale and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The earthquake occurred at 4 p.m. local time on April 2, 1868 and caused a landslide and tsunami that led to 77 deaths. The aftershock sequence for this event has continued up to the present day.
The 1868 Hayward earthquake occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States on October 21. With an estimated Richter magnitude of 6.8–7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), it was the most recent large earthquake to occur on the Hayward Fault Zone. It caused significant damage and a number of deaths throughout the region, and was known as the "Great San Francisco earthquake" prior to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
1869 (MDCCCLXIX) was a common year starting on Friday (dominical letter C) of the Gregorian calendar and a common year starting on Wednesday (dominical letter E) of the Julian calendar, the 1869th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 869th year of the 2nd millennium, the 69th year of the 19th century, and the 10th and last year of the 1860s decade. Note that the Julian day for 1869 is 12 calendar days difference, which continued to be used from 1582 until the complete conversion of the Gregorian calendar was entirely done in 1929.
The 1869 Christchurch earthquake occurred at 8:00 am local time on the morning of 5 June near New Brighton with an estimated Richter magnitude of 6.0. The shock had a Mercalli Intensity of VII–VIII and was thought to have been shallow.The shock damaged several brick and stone buildings in the city, destroying chimneys and damaging the spire of St John's church in Hereford Street.The effects of the earthquake on stone buildings such as St. Johns prompted the Church of St Michael and All Angels to be built using timber.
The 1872 North Cascades earthquake occurred at 5:40 a.m. local time in northern Washington state on December 15. A maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe) was assessed for several locations, though less intense shaking was observed at many other locations in Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia. Some of these intermediate outlying areas reported V (Moderate) to VII (Very strong) shaking, but intensities as high as IV (Light) were reported as far distant as Idaho and Montana. Due to the remote location of the mainshock and a series of strong aftershocks, damage to man made structures was limited to a few cabins close to the areas of the highest intensity.Because the earthquake occurred before seismometers were operating in the region, the magnitude of the shock and its location were never precisely determined, but the intensity reports that are available for the event were studied, and various epicenters for the event were proposed based on these limited data. One study presented an estimated moment magnitude of 6.5–7.0, with a proposed location on the east side of the Cascade Range near Lake Chelan. The results of a separate study indicated that it may have been a larger event, placing the shock in the North Cascades, just south of the Canada–United States border at Ross Lake.
The 1872 Lone Pine earthquake struck on March 26 at 10:30 UTC with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.4 to 7.9 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of X (Extreme). Its epicenter was near Lone Pine, California in Owens Valley. Historical evidence detailing the damage it caused in settlements, fault scarps, and the geographic extent to which noticeable movement was felt led researchers to the high magnitude estimate. It was one of the largest earthquakes to hit California in recorded history and was similar in size to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
The 1873 Alpago earthquake occurred near the Italian city of Belluno on June 29 in the geologically active Alpago Valley of the Veneto region; the zone is rated as two on a four-degree risk scale (one being the highest). The 6.3 magnitude quake was rated as IX–X (Violent–Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Damage was reported mostly in the provinces of Belluno, Treviso and Pordenone.
The 1875 Cúcuta earthquake also known as Earthquake of the Andes occurred on 18 May at 11:15 AM. It completely demolished Cúcuta, Villa del Rosario (Colombia), San Antonio del Tachira and Capacho (Venezuela). The earthquake killed many Venezuelans in San Cristóbal, La Mulata, Rubio, Michelena, La Grita, Colón, amongst others, and was felt in both Bogotá and Caracas.That day, the city of Cúcuta and the town of Villa del Rosario, in the Norte de Santander department (Colombia) and the municipalities of San Antonio del Táchira and Capacho, Táchira State (Venezuela) were destroyed totally by this catastrophic earthquake. Villa del Rosario was a historical and calm population. In 1821 had met in the main church (Historic church) to means to construct, the members of the First Congress of the Great Colombia, known as Congress of Cúcuta.Still it is observed the rest of the church that collapse during the great seismic movement, the houses of that time in the zone were of the purest Spanish colonial style.
The 1877 Iquique earthquake occurred at 21:16 local time on 9 May (0:59 on 10 May UTC). It had a magnitude of 8.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale. Other estimates of its magnitude have been as high as 9.0. It had a maximum intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale and triggered a devastating tsunami. A total of 2,541 people died, mainly in Peru and what is now northernmost Chile, with some deaths also reported from Hawaii and Japan.
The 1879 Gansu earthquake occurred at about 04:00 local time on 1 July. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicenter was in Wudu District in southern Gansu, close to the border with Sichuan. It caused widespread damage and killed an estimated 22,000 people.
The earthquakes of July 1880 in Luzon, the largest island of the Philippines, was one of the most destructive tremors on record in the history of the country. The shocks continued, with greater or less interruption, from the 14th to the 25th of the month, highlighted by three violent shaking events, which destroyed churches and other buildings, producing loss of life. Coinciding with the tectonic activity was an increased in volcanic activity in Taal Volcano in southwestern Luzon.The Luzon provinces of Manila, Cavite, Bulacan, Laguna, Pampanga, and Nueva Ecija, were the chief victims from the terrible convulsions with Manila and Laguna receiving the most damages. In many places, buildings were converted into shapeless heaps of ruins, and the materials of their prosperity buried beneath the rubbish.
The 1880 earthquake which struck Zagreb (also known as The Great Zagreb earthquake) was a 6.3 magnitude earthquake which occurred on 9 November 1880. Its epicenter was in the Medvednica mountain north of Zagreb. Although only one person was killed in the earthquake, it destroyed or damaged many buildings.According to the Zagreb Meteorological Station data, the earthquake struck at 07:33, and was followed by a series of tremors of smaller intensity. Contemporary records say that 3,800 outgoing tickets were sold at the Zagreb Main Station within the first 24 hours of the initial earthquake, as many locals sought to leave the city for Vienna, Ljubljana, Graz, and other Austro-Hungarian cities in the vicinity of Zagreb.City authorities formed a commission to assess the damage, and their official report said that a total of 1,758 buildings were affected (not counting churches and state-owned buildings), out of which 485 were heavily damaged.The most prominent building damaged was the Zagreb Cathedral, which then underwent a thorough reconstruction led by Hermann Bollé and which went on for 26 years before it was finally finished in 1906. However, the damage brought by the earthquake spurred construction and many historic buildings in the Lower Town area of the city were built in the following years.
The 1881 Chios earthquake occurred at 11:30 UTC on 3 April. It caused severe damage on the island of Chios and also affected Çeşme and Alaçatı on the coast of Turkey. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.3 and there were an estimated 7,866 casualties. The devastation from the earthquake was the last of the three 'catastrophes' that affected the island of Chios in the 19th century.
The 1881 Nicobar Islands earthquake occurred at about 07:49 local time (01:49 UTC) on 31 December, with an epicentre beneath Car Nicobar. It occurred as two separate ruptures, the largest of which had an estimated magnitude of 7.9 on the moment magnitude scale and triggered a tsunami that was observed around the Bay of Bengal. It is probably the earliest earthquake for which rupture parameters have been estimated instrumentally.
The Colchester earthquake, also known as the Great English earthquake, occurred on the morning of 22 April 1884 at 09:18. It caused considerable damage in Colchester and the surrounding villages in Essex. In terms of overall destruction caused it is certainly the most destructive earthquake to have hit the United Kingdom in at least the last 400 years, since the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580.At 9:18 am the earthquake struck, centred mainly in the villages of Wivenhoe, Abberton, Langenhoe, and Peldon causing the surrounding area to rise and fall violently as the waves spread, lasting for around 20 seconds. Measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale, the effects were felt across England, as well as in northern France and Belgium.The earthquake damaged about 1,250 buildings, including almost every building in Wivenhoe and Abberton, and in settlements all the way to Ipswich. The medieval church in Langenhoe was significantly damaged, as were those in the villages of Layer-de-la-Haye, Layer Marney, Layer Breton, and Peldon. In Peldon, the local newspapers claimed that every building had been damaged in some way. The Guardian reported that the earthquake was greeted with terror by the people near Colchester.There are some reports that between 3 and 5 people were killed by the earthquake, but this has been disputed by other contemporary accounts. The Times reported damage "in the many villages in the neighbourhood from Colchester to the sea coast", with many poor people made homeless, and estimated the cost of the disaster at £10,000. It did, however, mention the death of a child at Rowhedge, attributed to the earthquake. The large waves caused by the earthquake destroyed many small craft.It is believed that the earthquake resulted from movement along a fault in the ancient Palaeozoic rocks that underpin most of Essex, causing waves to propagate through the overlying Cretaceous and Tertiary layers.As is often the case, it is not always the strongest earthquakes that cause the most damage, and the British Geological Survey estimates that the 1884 earthquake's magnitude was only around 4.6 on the Richter Scale, compared with 6.1 for the 1931 Dogger Bank earthquake. Langenhoe Church was badly damaged. Masonry tumbled off the tower, crashing into the roof of the nave and chancel. The nearby rectory was also damaged.
The 1886 Charleston earthquake occurred at about 9:50 pm on August 31 with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The intraplate earthquake caused 60 deaths and between five and six million dollars in damage to 2,000 buildings in the Southeastern United States. It is one of the most powerful and damaging earthquakes to hit the East Coast of the United States. Very little to no historical earthquake activity had occurred, which is unusual for any seismic area.
The 1887 Sonora earthquake occurred at 22:13 UCT on 3 May in the Teras mountain range of northwestern Mexico. It was widely felt, with some damage being recorded up to 200 kilometres (120 mi) from the epicenter in both Mexico and the United States. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.6 and caused 42 casualties in the town of Bavispe and 51 overall. It was the only historical earthquake to cause considerable damage in Arizona. The 1887 Tombstone Arizona newspapers mentioned lesser quakes (aftershocks) on August 27, 1887 and November 11, 1887.
The 1888 North Canterbury earthquake occurred at 4:10 am on 1 September 1888 following a sequence of foreshocks that started the previous evening, and whose epicentre was in the North Canterbury region of the South Island of New Zealand. The epicentre was approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) west of Hanmer.In Christchurch, about 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the epicentre, shaking lasted for 40 to 50 seconds. The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be in the range 7.0–7.3. Severe damage to farm buildings in the epicentral region was reported and the top 7.8 metres (26 ft) of the spire of ChristChurch Cathedral collapsed. It was the first earthquake observed to be associated with mainly horizontal fault displacement.
The 1888 Río de la Plata earthquake occurred on June 5 measuring 5.5 on the Richter magnitude scale, and shook the upper Río de la Plata at 3:20 UTC-3. The epicentre was located 15 kilometres (9 mi) southwest of Colonia del Sacramento (Uruguay) and 42 kilometres (26 mi) east of Buenos Aires (Argentina), with a hypocentre at a depth of 30 kilometres (19 mi).
The 1889 Kumamoto earthquake occurred at 11.40 p.m local time on July 28 in the western part of Kumamoto. It was also called the Kinpozan earthquake (or Kinbozan earthquake, since its epicenter was the southern-eastern foot of Mount Kinpu) and its magnitude was 6.3.Twenty people died (5 in Kumamoto City and 15 in Akita Gun, Kumamoto Prefecture) and hundreds of houses and parts of Kumamoto Castle were destroyed. The earthquake was the first major one after the establishment of the Seismological Society of Japan (in 1880), and its waves were recorded as far as Potsdam, Germany. Few houses were affected by fire since the quake occurred at midnight. Aftershocks occurred for 5 months, and some people had to sleep outdoors. Tadao Shimoma thought that the earthquake was a combination of the Tatsuda fault and unsuccessful volcanic activities, since there were injections of aerosol into the air at many places around Mt. Kinpo, Ninotake and Sannotake. He claimed the Kinpo mountains (now showing no volcanic activities) are similar to Mt. Unzen in petrology. The photographs were considered the earliest earthquake damage photos in Japan.
The 1891 Mino–Owari earthquake (美濃尾張地震, Mino-Owari Jishin) struck the former Japanese provinces of Mino and Owari in the Nōbi Plain in the early morning of October 28 with a surface wave magnitude of 8.0. The event, also referred to as the Nōbi earthquake (濃尾地震, Nōbi Jishin) or the Great Nōbi earthquake (濃尾大地震, Nōbi Daijishin), is the strongest known inland earthquake to have occurred in the Japanese archipelago.The earthquake came at a time when Japan was undergoing a transformation into a more industrial nation and while advancing its scientific understanding in many fields. Damage from the event was widespread and the loss of life was significant. The many kilometers of visible fault breaks on the surface of the earth presented scientists with opportunities for field investigations that ultimately lead to an improved understanding of the fault scarps that earthquakes often generate.
The 1892 Recreo earthquake took place in the Catamarca Province of Argentina on 21 March 1892, at about 01:45 AM, with magnitude 6.0 in the Richter scale. Its epicenter was located approximately at 29°30′S 65°0′W, and at a depth of about 30 kilometres (19 mi).The earthquake had a maximum felt intensity of VII on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused some fatalities and serious structural damage in the town of Recreo.
The 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake occurred at 23:20 Pacific Standard Time on February 23. It had an estimated moment magnitude of 7.1–7.2 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was centered near the Mexico–United States border and takes its name from a large dry lake bed in Baja California, Mexico. There were no reported casualties, but the event affected the largely-uninhabited areas of northern Mexico and southern California.
The 1893 Quchan earthquake occurred at about 19:30 local time (15:06 UTC) on 17 November. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused severe damage in Quchan County, particularly to the town of Quchan itself and there were an estimated 18,000 casualties.
The first of the 1894 Atalanti earthquakes occurred at on 20 April 1894 at 16:52 UTC, with a magnitude of 6.4 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of X on the Mercalli intensity scale. It was followed 7 days later on 27 April at 19:42 UTC by the second, with a magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum intensity of X. These two earthquakes caused widespread damage in the Locris area, causing a total of 255 deaths. More literature on these destructive events can be seen in the references section.
The 1894 Istanbul earthquake occurred in the Çınarcık basin or Gulf of Izmit in the Sea of Marmara on 10 July at 12:24pm. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale. At least an estimated 1,349 people were killed in towns around the Gulf of Izmit such as Yalova, Sapanca and Adapazarı, and in the nearby city of Istanbul. The main shock caused a tsunami 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) high.
The 1894 Tokyo earthquake (明治東京地震, Meiji-Tokyo jishin) occurred in Tokyo, Japan at 14:04 PM on June 20. It affected downtown Tokyo and neighboring Kanagawa prefecture, especially the cities of Kawasaki and Yokohama.The earthquake had its epicenter in Tokyo Bay, with a magnitude of 6.6 on the Richter Scale. The depth of the 1894 earthquake has not been determined, but it is thought to have occurred within the subducting Pacific Plate under the Kantō region. The death toll was 31 killed and 157 injured.The earthquake was mentioned by author Ichiyō Higuchi in her work Mizu-no-ue no nikki, in which she described damage to buildings in Yotsuya, and soil liquefaction in the Mita area of downtown Tokyo. She also commented on an aftershock which occurred at 2200 that night. The earthquake is also mentioned by author Jun'ichirō Tanizaki in his autobiographical work, Yosho-jidai, in which he described how his family’s house collapsed during the earthquake, a traumatic event to which he attributed his lifelong phobia of earthquakes. By 1894, Tokyo and Yokohama had numerous foreign residents, many of whom commented on the earthquake in their writings and diaries.The National Science Museum of Japan in Tokyo has a collection of twenty two photographs of the earthquake in the form of albumen papers, lantern slides and dry plates. A considerable number of photographs were taken just after the event for the use at the former Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee in its official reports of the 1894 earthquake, but almost all of the original plates have been lost.
The 1894 San Juan earthquake was a major seismic movement that took place in the province of San Juan, Argentina, on 27 October 1894, at about 07:30 PM. It was the most powerful earthquake recorded in Argentina, with magnitude 7.5 on the Surface wave magnitude. Its epicenter was located to the northwest of San Juan, approximately at 29°48′S 69°00′W, and at a depth of 30 km.The maximum perceived intensity for the earthquake was IX on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused severe damage and about 100 casualties in San Juan and the province of La Rioja, and also minor damages in Catamarca, Córdoba, San Luis and Mendoza, up to 500 km away from the epicenter.
The 1895 Quchan earthquake occurred at about 11:30 local time (08:30 UTC) on 17 January. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused severe damage in Quchan County, particularly to the town of Quchan itself and there were an estimated 1,000–11,000 casualties. It was the last in a sequence of major damaging earthquakes that struck the area between 1851 and 1895.
The 1895 Ljubljana earthquake (Slovene: ljubljanski potres) or the Easter earthquake (Slovene: velikonočni potres) struck Ljubljana (the capital and largest city of Carniola, a Crown land of Austria-Hungary and the capital of Slovenia) on Easter Sunday, 14 April. It was the most destructive and the last destructive earthquake in the area.
The 1896 Sanriku earthquake was one of the most destructive seismic events in Japanese history. The 8.5 magnitude earthquake occurred at 19:32 (local time) on June 15, 1896, approximately 166 kilometres (103 mi) off the coast of Iwate Prefecture, Honshu. It resulted in two tsunamis which destroyed about 9,000 homes and caused at least 22,000 deaths. The waves reached a record height of 38.2 metres (125 ft); more than a meter lower than those created after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake which was much greater than expected for the estimated seismic magnitude. This earthquake is now regarded as being part of a distinct class of seismic events, the tsunami earthquake.
The 1897 Mindanao earthquakes occurred on 20 September at 19:06 UTC and 21 September at 05:12 UTC. The estimated epicentres of the two earthquakes are identical, lying just off the southwestern coast of Mindanao in the Philippines, south of Basilan island. The earthquakes were originally given estimated magnitudes of 8.6 and 8.7 on the surface wave magnitude scale by Charles Richter, but these were revised downwards by Katsuyuki Abe to 7.4 and 7.5 Ms, respectively. Contemporary reports noted that with few exceptions, all the masonry buildings in Zamboanga and Basilan were left in ruins.Both earthquakes triggered tsunamis, with the second being quite destructive, with a maximum run-up of 7.0 m. The tsunami was noted all along the southwest coast of Negros, the west coast of Panay, the south coast of Palawan, the west coast of Mindanao, and the east coast of Borneo. At least 13 died as a result of the second tsunami, with a hundred or more casualties also being reported.
The Assam earthquake of 1897 occurred on June 12 in Assam, India, and had an estimated moment magnitude of 8.3. Considering the size of the earthquake, the mortality rate was not that high, with about 1,542 casualties, but property damage was very heavy. Damage from the earthquake extended into Kolkata where dozens of buildings were badly damaged or partially collapsed. Shaking from the event was felt across India, as far as Ahmedabad and Peshawar. Seiches were also observed in Burma.
The 1901 Black Sea earthquake (also known in Bulgaria as Balchik earthquake) was a 7.2 magnitude earthquake, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the Black Sea. The earthquake epicenter was located in the east of Cape Shabla-Kaliakra, 30 km off northwest coast of Bulgaria. The mainshock occurred at a depth of 15 km and generated a 4–5 m high tsunami that devastated the coastal areas of Romania and Bulgaria. In Romania, the earthquake was felt not only throughout Dobrogea, but also in Oltenia and Muntenia, and even in southern Moldova.The earthquake was followed by a large number of local replicas and secondary earthquakes, which occurred over many years, until 1905; the strongest aftershocks reached magnitudes of 5.5-6.0 on the Richter scale and were also felt in southern Romania, including Bucharest. After 1905, Pontic seismic activity began to subside, although weak and moderate earthquakes were also reported in subsequent years.Such events are rare in the Black Sea. In the last 200 years, in the Black Sea region 24 tsunamis occurred, of which two were in the territory of Dobrogea. The earliest recorded tsunami in Romania dates from 104, when the city of Callatis, current Mangalia, was badly affected.
The 1901 Cheviot earthquake occurred at 07:47 NZT on 16 November 1901 with an estimated magnitude of 6.9 centred near the township of Cheviot in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand.
The 1902 Andijan earthquake occurred on December 16 with a surface wave magnitude of 6.4 and a maximum perceived Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The shock claimed between 700 and 4,880 casualties and more than 40,000 homes were destroyed in the Andijan Region of Uzbekistan.
The 1902 Guatemala earthquake occurred on April 18 at 8:23 pm with a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The tremor was roughly 25 km (16 mi) in focal depth; in addition, the time interval of the earthquake was 1 to 2 minutes.The foreshock and aftershock series of this incident were major. Before the main shock, there were earthquakes being felt for three months and the tremors afterwards persisted for more than two weeks. A majority of churches in western Guatemala and eastern Chiapas were either severely devastated or abolished. The number of people killed was between 800 and 2,000.A strange occurrence of heavy rains, lightning, and thunder took place shortly before the earthquake. A few weeks before to the earthquake there was rain every afternoon for several days straight. Guatemala City was instantly flooded when massive gaps opened in the streets, water pipes ruptured, and huts along with cathedrals disintegrated and collapsed, which also buried hundreds. In just one hour, approximately 80,000 people were made homeless.As soon as the earthquake took place the sky cleared up and there was no rain for approximately three weeks. It has been said that the earthquake had something to do with an atmospheric disturbance connected with an electrical nature. The reason for this is because the early storms were electrical storms.
The 1903 Manzikert earthquake struck Manzikert of nowadays Muş Province in eastern Turkey on 28 April. Registering a surface wave magnitude of 7.0, the earthquake originated from a highly active seismic zone. It killed 3,500 people and 20,000 animals, destroyed 12,000 homes, and is now listed among the world's deadliest earthquakes in recorded history. To this day, Turkey is threatened by major earthquakes – more than 100 earthquakes over 7.0 have taken place in the country's known history.
The 1904 Douliu earthquake (Chinese: 1904年斗六地震; pinyin: 1904 nián Dǒuliù dìzhèn) struck central Taiwan with a magnitude of 6.1 at 04:25 on November 6. The quake caused widespread damage and killed 145 people, making it the fifth deadliest earthquake of the 20th century in Taiwan.
The 1904 Samos earthquake struck Greece on August 11 with Richter magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). Four people were killed.
The 1905 Bolnai earthquake occurred in or near the Asgat Sum of Zavkhan Province in Mongolia on 23 July. The earthquake has been estimated at 8.25 to 8.5 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 1905 Kangra earthquake occurred in the Kangra Valley and the Kangra region of the Punjab Province (modern day Himachal Pradesh) in India on 4 April 1905. The earthquake measured 7.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale and killed more than 20,000 people. Apart from this, most buildings in the towns of Kangra, Mcleodganj and Dharamshala were destroyed.
The 1905 Tsetserleg earthquake occurred in or near the Tsetserleg Sum of Khövsgöl Province in Mongolia on 9 July 1905. The earthquake has been estimated at 7.9 to 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale.
Striking southern Italy on September 8, the 1905 Calabria earthquake had a moment magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The first major earthquake of the 20th century, it damaged parts of Lipari Island and Messina Province, and killed between 557 and 2,500 people. The earthquake affected the Calabria region, destroying as many as 25 villages, and 14,000 homes.
The 1906 Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred at 00:10 UTC on August 17. It had an estimated seismic moment of 3.8 x 1028 dyn cm−1, equivalent to a magnitude of 8.35 on the moment magnitude scale. This earthquake was followed thirty minutes later by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake in Chile, but the two events are not thought to be linked. Due to the remote location, there are no reports of damage associated with this earthquake. A transpacific tsunami reported from Japan and Hawaii was triggered by the Chilean event, rather than the Aleutian Islands earthquake.
The 1906 Ecuador–Colombia earthquake occurred at 15:36 UTC on January 31, off the coast of Ecuador, near Esmeraldas. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 8.8 and triggered a destructive tsunami that caused at least 500 casualties on the coast of Colombia.
The 1906 Meishan earthquake (Chinese: 1906年梅山地震; pinyin: 1906 nián Měishān Dìzhèn) was centered on modern day Meishan, Chiayi County, Taiwan and occurred on March 17 (during Japanese rule). Referred to at the time as the Great Ka-gi earthquake (Chinese: 嘉義大地震; pinyin: Jiāyì Dà Dìzhèn), it is the third-deadliest earthquake in Taiwan's recorded history, claiming around 1,260 lives. The shock had a Richter magnitude of 7.1 and a Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent).
The 1906 Swansea earthquake hit near the town of Swansea, Glamorgan, Wales on 27 June. It was one of the most damaging to hit Britain during the twentieth century.
The 1906 Valparaíso earthquake hit Valparaíso, Chile, on August 16 at 19:55 local time. Its epicenter was offshore from the Valparaíso Region, and its intensity was estimated at magnitude 8.2 MW.Much of Valparaíso was destroyed; there was severe damage in central Chile from Illapel to Talca. The earthquake was felt from Tacna, Peru to Puerto Montt. Reports said the earthquake lasted four minutes. A tsunami was also generated. The earthquake killed a reported 3,886 people.The record of previous seismic activity includes major earthquakes in 1647, 1730 and 1822. The 1906 disaster was predicted by Captain Arturo Middleton, Chief of the Chilean Army Meteorological Office, in a letter that was published in El Mercurio, one week before it occurred.Admiral Luis Gómez Carreño ordered the shooting of at least 15 people, who were caught looting after the earthquake. A Board for Reconstruction was formed some weeks after the earthquake. The Seismological Service of Chile was also created. Fernand de Montessus de Ballore was appointed as the first chief executive of the Service.
On October 23, 1907, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Calabria, at a depth of 33.0 km. in the area of Gerace-Siderno, on the southeast coast of Calabria. The event caused 167 deaths and major damage.The epicentral area included only one town (Ferruzzano), where many houses collapsed almost completely, and 158 persons, or 8% of its population, were killed. Ferruzano had been hit as well in the 1905 Calabria earthquake.Almost a month later, on November 17, 1907, the area of Ferruzzano, Brancaleone and Bianco was hit again. On January 23, 1908, the area was hit again by an earthquake. People had to camp in the fields or in nearby subterranean grottos. In Ferruzzano new houses built after the earthquakes of 1905 and 1907 resisted the shocks of the 1908 Messina earthquake.
The 1907 Kingston earthquake which shook the capital of the island of Jamaica with a magnitude of 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale on Monday January 14, at about 3:30 pm local time (20:36 UTC), was considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes recorded in history. Every building in Kingston was damaged by the earthquake and subsequent fires, which lasted for three hours before any efforts were made to check them, culminated in the death of 800 to 1,000 people, and left approximately 10,000 homeless and $25,000,000 in material damage.Shortly after, a tsunami was reported on the north coast of Jamaica, with a maximum wave height of about 2 m (6–8 ft).
The 1907 Qaratog earthquake occurred at 04:23 UTC on 21 October near Qaratog (Karatag) in the border area between Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The shock had an estimated surface wave magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Estimates of the death toll range between 12,000 and 15,000.
The 1908 Messina earthquake (also known as the 1908 Messina and Reggio earthquake) occurred on December 28 in Sicily and Calabria, southern Italy with a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The cities of Messina and Reggio Calabria were almost completely destroyed and between 75,000 and 200,000 lives were lost.
The 1909 Borujerd earthquake also known as Silakhor earthquake occurred in Silakhor plain (in the south of today's Borujerd County), Persia (modern day Iran) on January 23. Around 8,000 fatalities were caused directly from the magnitude 7.3 earthquake. An indefinite number of aftershocks continued for six months after the main shock. The section on this fault ruptured was the same as the main rupture zone of the 2006 Borujerd earthquake.
The 1909 Provence earthquake occurred on June 11 in Provence. Measuring 6 on the Richter Scale, it is the largest ever recorded earthquake in metropolitan France.A total of 46 people died, another 250 were injured, and approximately 2,000 buildings were damaged.The most damaged communes were Salon-de-Provence, Vernègues, Lambesc, Saint-Cannat and Rognes.Fourteen people died in Rognes, which was half destroyed, especially the houses on the flanks of the hill Le Foussa. People were relocated under tents on another hill Le devin and near the primary school. The main shock occurred at 9:15pm. If the earthquake had happened an hour later, more people would have been in bed, and more casualties would have been recorded.The Vernègues castle and most of the houses in Vernègues were destroyed. Two people died in the village, which was later rebuilt at a lower altitude.
The 1909 Wabash River earthquake occurred at 04:45 local time on September 27 with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). It measured 5.1 on a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or the event's felt area. With moderate damage in the Wabash River Valley, it is currently the strongest earthquake recorded in the U.S. state of Indiana. The earthquake occurred somewhere along a fault within the Wabash Valley Seismic Zone.
The 1911 Sarez earthquake occurred at 18:41 UTC on 18 February (23:31 local time) in the central Pamir Mountains in the Rushon District of eastern Tajikistan. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.4 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of about IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a massive landslide, blocking the Murghab River and forming the Usoi Dam, the tallest dam in the world, creating Sarez Lake. The earthquake and related landslides destroyed many buildings and killed about 90 people.
The 1911 Guerrero earthquake occurred on December 16 at 12:14 local time near the coast of Guerrero, Mexico along the Mexican subduction zone. The earthquake's energy was calculated using several different magnitude scales with an estimated moment magnitude of 7.6 and a surface wave magnitude of 7.8. Following the event, telegraphy reports came in from a broad area of Mexico. Cities from Guadalajara, Mérida (on the Yucatán Peninsula), and Tapachula (near Guatemala) all reported the tremors. The duration of the shaking was just over two minutes and the death toll was placed at 28.
The 1911 Kikai Island earthquake (1911年喜界島地震 Sen-kyūhyaku-jyūichi-nen Kikai-jima Jishin) occurred on June 15 at 14:26 UTC (23:26 local time). The earthquake was located near Kikai Island, Japan. It had a magnitude of Ms 8.1.The earthquake occurred near the northern end of the deepest region in Ryukyu Trench. The hypocenter was located near 28.00°E, 130.00°N, about 30 km south of the Kikai Island, with a depth of about 100 km. However, due to the instrumental precision of that time, the location of the hypocenter was just an approximation, and estimations differ. A recent study estimated that the hypocenter was located near 28.90°E, 130.25°N, about 60 km NNE of the Kikai Island, with a depth of about 30 km.Twelve people were reported dead, including one on Kikai Island. Four hundred and twenty two houses were completely destroyed, 401 of which on Kikai Island. Damage was also reported on Amami Ōshima, Toku-no-shima, and Okinawa Island. The wall of Shuri Castle in Shuri was damaged. A tsunami was triggered by the earthquake, which was recorded on Kikai Island and Amami Ōshima. This earthquake could be felt as far as in Shanghai, China, Tainan, Taiwan (then under Japanese rule), and Fukushima, Japan.
The 1911 Michoacán earthquake occurred on June 7 at 11:02 UTC. However, other sources indicated that this earthquake occurred at 04:26 local time. The epicenter was located near the coast of Michoacán, Mexico. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.6 on the moment magnitude scale. 45 people were reported dead. In Mexico City, 119 houses were destroyed. Cracks were reported in Palacio Nacional, Escuela Normal para Maestros, Escuela Preparatoria, Inspección de Policía, and Instituto Geológico. Ciudad Guzmán, the seat of Zapotlán el Grande, Jalisco, suffered great damage.The earthquake occurred hours before the revolutionary Francisco I. Madero entered Mexico City in the same day, and it was also known as "temblor maderista".On June 7, 2011, a ceremony was held in Ciudad Guzmán commemorating the centenary of this earthquake.This earthquake was a megathrust earthquake along the Middle America Trench (MAT), a major subduction zone.
The 1911 Kebin earthquake, or 1911 Chon-Kemin earthquake, struck Russian Turkestan on 3 January. Registering at a 7.7 magnitude, it destroyed more than 770 buildings (which was almost all of the city) in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and resulted in 125 miles (201 km) of surface faulting in the valleys of Chon–Kemin, Chilik and Chon-Aksu.
The 1913 Asmara earthquake took place outside Asmara, Eritrea on 27 February. The data as to the magnitude of the earthquake is imprecise due to the frequency and magnitude of aftershocks, but a maximum felt intensity of VI (Strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale was recorded at Asmara. The "felt" area of the earthquake extended into Northern Ethiopia as well as Kassala in Sudan. The earthquake caused significant damage in Asmara (VI), Keren (IV), Massawa (V) and Adi Ugri (V).
The 1914 Burdur earthquake occurred at 00:07 local time (22:07 UTC) on 4 October. It was estimated to be 7.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale with a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It was centered near Lake Burdur in southwestern Turkey and the mainshock and subsequent fire destroyed more than 17,000 homes, and caused 2,344 casualties.In Burdur nearly 100 percent of the homes were destroyed along with other significant and historical monuments. Kilinc was completely destroyed and in Keciborlu around 85 percent of the houses were lost. In the city of Isparta the great Mosque was destroyed along with more than half of the homes. Other villages were also impacted as far as 60 kilometers (37 mi) from the epicenter.The earthquake, along with several others in 1959 and 1971, occurred along the Fethiye-Burdur fault zone, a parallel and discontinuous series of fault segments. No unambiguous fault displacement has been found that is related to the event, but a 23 km (14 mi) portion of the southeast coast of Lake Burdur experienced subsidence of up to 150 centimeters (59 in) and this may indicate that the event was due to normal faulting with a strike of N45°E.
The 1915 Asmara earthquake took place outside Asmara, Eritrea on September 23. The event causeed panic among the inhabitants and minor damage. The earthquake is described by experts as being of relatively large magnitude.
The 1915 Avezzano earthquake occurred on January 13 in central Italy at 07:52:42 local time. The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The epicenter was located in the town of Avezzano (which was destroyed) in the Province of L'Aquila. Around 30,000 direct fatalities and $60 million in damage resulted from the earthquake.
The 1915 Pleasant Valley earthquake occurred at 22:53:21 on October 2 in north-central Nevada. With a moment magnitude of 6.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme), it was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the state.
The 1916 Irondale earthquake struck north–central Alabama on October 18. The greatest earthquake in state history, it registered an estimated magnitude of 5.1 on the Richter magnitude scale and resulted in extensive minor damage. Damage, limited to Shelby and Jefferson counties, reached its maximum severity near the epicenter in the city of Irondale, including cracked windows, fallen chimneys, and dried-up wells. While there were no fatalities, the earthquake spawned widespread panic, sending alarmed workers from tall buildings.The earthquake originated in the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, a fault noted for earthquakes of moderate magnitude. Faulting in the area is strike-slip-oriented probably because of the Alabama-New York Lineament, which runs adjacent to the fault. Several scientists believe that the small earthquakes from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep, ancient faults. Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century. The earthquakes have been moderate, never reaching above magnitude 5.1, and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away. Major events include those in 1916, 1997, and 2003. Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama, earthquakes from nearby fault zones, including the New Madrid Seismic Zone, pose a serious threat to infrastructure. Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916 Irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $1 billion in damage.

It caused widespread damage across Bali, particularly in the south of the island. It triggered many landslides, which caused 80% of the 1500 casualties.
The 1917 Guatemala earthquake was a sequence of tremors that lasted from 17 November 1917 through 24 January 1918. They gradually increased in intensity until they almost completely destroyed Guatemala City and severely damaged the ruins in Antigua Guatemala that had survived the 1773 Guatemala earthquakes.
The 1917 Samoa earthquake occurred on June 26 at 05:49 UTC. The epicenter was located in the southwest of the Samoan Islands. The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 8.5, or Ms 8.4, one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in this region.Many subsidences were reported. In the mountains, masses of rocks were hurled down. In Apia, violent shaking lasted for about a minute and half. In American Samoa, the LDS Church in Pago Pago and the Catholic Church in Leone were partly demolished. A tsunami was triggered by the earthquake, which affected both American Samoa and German Samoa, which was then under Allied occupation. The tsunami reached a maximum of 40 feet. The maximum range of the tsunami in Apia was about 80 cm. Many houses were destroyed, and a bridge was washed away in Palauli. The tsunami was also recorded in Honolulu and on the west coast of the United States. Just on May 1, 1917, a large earthquake of magnitude Ms 8.0 occurred in the Kermadec Islands region. The tsunami caused by the earthquake in May also hit the Samoan Islands.The earthquake occurred to the southwest of the Samoa Islands, along the Tonga Plate boundary. The focal mechanism of this earthquake was unclear. This earthquake and the 2009 event were not thought to represent the same repeating process in a same location.
The 1918 Celebes Sea earthquake occurred on 15 August at 12:18 UTC. It had a magnitude of 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale.

The 1930 North Izu earthquake (1930年北伊豆地震, Sen-kyūhyaku-sanjū-nen Kita-Izu Jishin) occurred on November 26 at 04:02 local time. The epicenter was located in the northern Izu Peninsula, Japan. It had a magnitude of Ms 7.3. The earthquake was caused by the movement of the Tanna Fault (丹那断層).
The 1930 Pyu earthquake occurred on December 4 at 01:21 local time. The epicenter was located north to Bago, Burma, then part of British India. The magnitude of the earthquake was put at Mw 7.3, or Ms 7.3.Before the earthquake, a tremor occurred at 16:36 UTC, and its shaking was felt much milder in Yangon. 36 deaths were reported in the earthquake. The earthquake caused severe damage to Pyu, about 130 km north of Bago. Many of the masonry buildings in Pyu were wrecked. The area between Nyaunglebin and Toungoo was hardest hit. Many buildings of filmsy constructions were destroyed. Many railway bridges were damaged. Many freight cars and one locomotive were derailed and turned over. The intensity of this earthquake reached Rossi-Forel VIII–IX, corresponding to MM VII–IX. This earthquake could be felt in Bangkok, Thailand, about 660 km away. It was reported that the water in the Khlong Saen Saeb was agitated violently and overflowed its banks more than once.This earthquake and the Bago earthquake on May 5, 1930 were both located in the area of the Sagaing Fault. The Sagaing Fault is a right-lateral strike-slip fault that accommodates much of the shear component of the highly oblique relative motion between the India Plate and the Sunda Plate. This fault influences segments of the path of the Irrawady north of Mandalay. The Bago earthquake on May 5, 1930 may have triggered the 1930 Pyu earthquake. The distribution of the intensities of the both earthquakes suggests that at least a 50-km long section of the Sagaing Fault between the two events of 1930 did not rupture during either of these two earthquakes.
The 1930 Salmas earthquake occurred on May 7 at 01:34:26 IRST in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran. The earthquake, which was among Iran's largest, measured 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). A damaging foreshock occurred fifteen hours prior to the main event and served as a warning to the people that felt it strongly. Reports from seismologists and seismological organizations indicate that up to 3,000 fatalities may have occurred in western Iran and eastern Turkey.Sixty villages (including the large settlement of Dilman, which was relocated and rebuilt as Salmas) were destroyed in the Salmas Plain and in the surrounding mountainous regions. A destructive aftershock sequence affected many villages, and in some cases, damage was inflicted on some that had escaped devastation during the mainshock. An inspection of the region was undertaken, but not until decades later, at which time substantial surface faulting and other ground effects were documented.
The 1930 Senigallia earthquake struck the city of Senigallia in central Italy on October 30. It occurred just a few months after the destructive 1930 Irpinia earthquake, which had caused over 1400 casualties in the southern part of the country.
The 1931 Myitkyina earthquake, or also known as the 1931 Kamaing earthquake, occurred on January 27 at 20:09 UTC. However, according to different sources, it occurred on January 28, 1931 at 02:35 local time. It was located in northern Burma, then part of British India. The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Mw 7.6. According to some sources the depth was 35 km, and according to a study of Phyo M. M. the depth was 5 to 30 km.The shock was very violent and lasted at least 30 seconds. The intensity reached MMI IX. There were numerous fissures and cracks. Sand blows were reported. The earthquake might have caused slip of the Sagaing Fault. The Sagaing Fault is a continental transform fault between the India Plate and the Sunda Plate. This earthquake is located along the northern Sagaing Fault. Sagaing Fault at 22° N is narrow, about 10 km wide. The part of Sagaing Fault between 25°30' and 26° is wider, with a shear zone about 70 km wide, and has four branches identified.

It had a magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter magnitude scale, and it caused a shaking intensity of III (Weak) to IV (Light) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The location of the earthquake in the North Sea meant that damage was significantly less than it would have been had the epicentre been on the British mainland.
The 1931 Fuyun earthquake (富蕴地震) occurred on August 10 at 21:18 UTC. The epicenter was near Fuyun County of northern Xinjiang, China. It was a Mw 8.0 earthquake and had a surface rupture of 171 km with a maximal horizontal displacement of 14 m along the Koktokay-Ertai fault zone (可可托海-二台断裂带). The Koktokay-Ertai fault has a slip rate of 4±2 mm per year. The rupture of this earthquake was caused by right-lateral strike-slip movement with normal component. The rupture is well preserved and becomes one of the main features of the Koktokay National Geopark (可可托海国家地质公园) located in Koktokay.

The 1931 Zangezur earthquake occurred on April 27 at 20:50:45 local time with a moment magnitude of 6.5. The earthquake was located in the Zangezur Mountains near the boundary between southwestern Armenia and Azerbaijan's exclave, the Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic. Both territories were part of the Soviet Union at that time.The earthquake was located near the border between the Syunik Province of Armenia (Zangezur is an alternative name for the region of Syunik Province) and the Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. Up to 2,890 were reported dead. In Armenia, 57 villages were destroyed or heavily damaged in the Sisian-Goris area and in Azerbaijan, 46 villages were destroyed or seriously damaged in the Ordubad area. In another source it was reported that the earthquake destroyed 254 villages. In southeastern Armenia, the historical Tatev Monastery was damaged. The intensities reached MSK-64 IX in Shamb and MSK-64 VIII in Jougha. The Museum of History in Sisian has some photos taken after the town was hit by the earthquake.The Pambak-Sevan-Sunik Fault extends in the NW-SE direction. The fault can be traced continuously for 400 km and consists of four major segments. The 1931 Zangezur earthquake was located in the area of the Sunik-Zanghezour segment, which is about 120 km long.There was a period of increased earthquake activity in Armenia and its neighboring republics between 1911 and 1956 and the 1931 event was one of the strongest. It released about half of the total energy of all the earthquakes occurring in the Caucasus region near the Caspian Sea in that period.
The 1932 Jalisco earthquakes began on June 3 at 10:36 UTC with a megathrust event that registered 8.2 on the moment magnitude scale. With a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, at least 400 deaths were caused in Mexico and neighboring Guatemala. It was the first of a series of seismic events that affected parts of western Mexico during the month of June 1932, all reaching magnitude 7 or greater.The Mexican subduction zone, the Middle America Trench, is seismically active and has generated both destructive and non-destructive tsunamis. Each earthquake in the series caused significant damage, injuries, and deaths, and in each case tsunamis of various heights were generated, with the June 22 catastrophic tsunami in Cuyutlán and San Blas being described as one of the most destructive events in the region based on all available historical records.

The 1935 Hsinchu-Taichung earthquake occurred with a Richter magnitude of 7.1 on 21 April 1935 with its epicenter in Sansa Village (三叉), Shinchiku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (present-day Sanyi, Miaoli County, Taiwan). It was the deadliest earthquake in Taiwan's recorded history, claiming 3,276 lives and causing extensive damage. Twelve seconds after the mainshock, an aftershock of ML 6.0 occurred, centered on Gabi Village (present-day Emei Township, Hsinchu County).
The 1935 Sumatra earthquake occurred at 09:35 local time on 28 December. It had a magnitude of Mw = 7.7 and a maximum felt intensity of VIII (Severe) on the mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a minor tsunami.
The 1935 Temiskamingue earthquake occurred on November 1 with a moment magnitude of 6.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The event took place in the Western Quebec Seismic Zone in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region of Quebec.
The 1936 Cansiglio earthquake occurred on October 18 in the region between the provinces of Belluno, Treviso and Pordenone, in northern Italy. It caused 19 deaths and an unknown number of injuries.

Building damage was reported. In Isobe (磯部) village, nowadays part of Sōma, Fukushima, a small market building collapsed. A tsunami was recorded.This was one of the recurring interplate earthquakes at the offshore Miyagi with a recurrence interval of about 37 years. Although not officially named by the Japanese Meteorological Agency, in Japanese, this earthquake is commonly known as 1936年宮城県沖地震 (Sen-kyūhyaku-sanjūroku-nen Miyagi-ken-oki Jishin) or 1936年金華山沖地震 (Sen-kyūhyaku-sanjūroku-nen Kinkasan-oki Jishin).
The 1937 Orizaba earthquake occurred on July 26 at 03:47 UTC, near Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. It had a magnitude of 7.3 on the surface wave magnitude scale. Thirty four people were reported dead. Damage was reported in Esperanza, Puebla. This was an intraplate earthquake within the subducting Cocos Plate.
The 1938 Banda Sea earthquake occurred in the Banda Sea region on February 1. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, and intensities as high as VII (Very strong). It generated destructive tsunamis of up to 1.5 metres, but no human lives were lost.
The 1938 Kırşehir earthquake occurred at 12:59 local time on 19 April. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 224 casualties.
The 1939 Chillán earthquake occurred in south-central Chile on 24 January and had a surface wave magnitude of 8.3. With a death toll of around 28,000, compared to the 2,231 – 6,000 (official estimates vary greatly) of the Great Chilean earthquake of 1960, it is the single deadliest earthquake in Chile.
The 1939 Erzincan earthquake was a major natural disaster that hit Erzincan Province in eastern Turkey at 1:57:23 a.m. on 27 December local time. The sequence of seven violent shocks, the biggest one measuring magnitude 7.8, was one of the most powerful to strike Turkey.The first stage of the earthquake killed about 8,000 people. The next day, it was reported that the death toll had risen to 20,000. An emergency relief operation began. By January 5, almost 33,000 had died due to the earthquakes and to blizzard conditions, followed by heavy rains that caused floods. So extensive was the damage to Erzincan city that its old site was entirely abandoned and a new town was founded a little further to the north.In the next few years there were three more 7+ magnitude quakes in the region. Turkey soon adopted seismic building regulations.
The 1940 Vrancea earthquake, also known as the 1940 Bucharest earthquake, (Romanian: Cutremurul din 1940) occurred on Sunday, 10 November 1940, in Romania, at 3:39am (local time), when the majority of the population was at home.The 1940 earthquake registered a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale, being the strongest earthquake recorded in the 20th century in Romania. Its epicenter lay in Vrancea zone at a depth of about 133 km. The pleistoseist area of this earthquake was of 80,000 km² and the macroseismic effects were felt on a surface of over 2,000,000 km², being reported on vast areas, thus: in the north up to Saint Petersburg, at over 1,300 km, where there have been estimated seismic intensities of IV–V (MCS degrees), in the south, up to Greece, in the east, up to the Kharkiv–Moscow line, with estimated intensities of V–VI (MCS degrees), in the west, up to Belgrade, Budapest, Warsaw.
The 1940 El Centro earthquake (or 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake) occurred at 21:35 Pacific Standard Time on May 18 (05:35 UTC on May 19) in the Imperial Valley in southeastern Southern California near the international border of the United States and Mexico. It had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It was the first major earthquake to be recorded by a strong-motion seismograph located next to a fault rupture. The earthquake was characterized as a typical moderate-sized destructive event with a complex energy release signature. It was the strongest recorded earthquake to hit the Imperial Valley, and caused widespread damage to irrigation systems and led to the deaths of nine people.
The 1940 New Hampshire earthquakes struck on December 20 and again on December 24. The initial shock measured 5.3 and the second shock measured 5.6 on the moment magnitude scale. With a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong), these doublet earthquakes were the largest to hit the state. Damage included minor fractures or knocked over chimneys in a zone extending through New Hampshire and four other states: Maine, New York, Vermont and Massachusetts.
The 1941 Andaman Islands earthquake struck the Andaman Islands on June 26 with a magnitude of 7.7 to 8.1. Details of this event are poorly known as much of Southeast Asia was in the turmoil of World War II. The quake caused severe damage in the Andaman Islands and as many as 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, and Sri Lanka. There may have been damage and deaths in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand due to the tsunami.
The 1941 Colima earthquake occurred on April 15 at 19:09 UTC (13:09 local time). The epicenter was located in the State of Michoacán, Mexico.The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Ms 7.7 or Mw 7.6. The intensities were MM X in Colima, MM VIII in Manzanillo, and MM V in Mexico City. 90 people were reported dead. The cathedral of Colima was destroyed. Many houses and public buildings in Colima, including the Federal Palace (Palacio federal) and the Hidalgo Theater (Teatro Hidalgo), were damaged. 900 or 2000 of the 8000 houses in the city of Colima collapsed, according to different sources.This earthquake was an interplate earthquake between the Cocos Plate and the North American Plate. It occurred in the Colima region of the Middle America Trench. This earthquake was very close to where the 1973 Colima earthquake occurred. From the locally recorded time intervals between the arrival of the S wave and the P wave (S-P times) and from the felt intensities, it is suggested that the rupture zone of this earthquake was larger than the 1973 earthquake and may have extended into the rupture zone of the 1985 Michoacán earthquake.
The 1941 Chungpu earthquake (Chinese: 1941年中埔地震; pinyin: 1941 nián Zhōngpǔ Dìzhèn) occurred with a magnitude of 7.1 on December 17, and was centred on the town of Chungpu, Taiwan. It was the fourth-deadliest earthquake of the 20th century in Taiwan, claiming 358 lives.
The 1941 Van–Erciş earthquake occurred at 23:53 local time on 10 September. It had an estimated magnitude of 5.9 and a maximum intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 192 casualties.
The 1942 Guatemala earthquake occurred at 17:37 local time on August 6 and had ratings of 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale and 7.9 on the surface wave magnitude scale. The epicenter was located off the southern coast of Guatemala, and it was one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded there.The earthquake caused widespread damage in the west-central highlands of Guatemala. Thirty-eight people died in the earthquake. Landslides caused by the combination of the earthquake and the heavy seasonal rains destroyed roads, the Inter-American Highway, and telegraph lines. In Tecpán Guatemala, more than 60% of the houses were demolished. Damage was reported in some buildings in Antigua Guatemala, including the Palacio de Los Capitanes Generales and some catholic churches. The earthquake could also be felt strongly in Mexico and El Salvador.This earthquake was a lower crustal intraplate earthquake with a compressional focal mechanism. Tensional activity has been dominant along the down-dip edge along the 1942 rupture zone. It was estimated that earthquakes near the Middle America Trench with magnitudes of about 7.5~8.0 occurred at intervals of 94 ± 54 yrs in southwestern Guatemala. Such historical earthquakes included the earthquakes in 1765, 1902, and 1942.
The 1942 Niksar–Erbaa earthquake occurred at 16:03 local time on 20 December. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 3,000 casualties.
The 1942 Peru earthquake occurred on August 24 at 17:50 local time and was located near the border of the departments of Ica and Arequipa, Peru. It had a magnitude of Mw 8.2, or Ms 8.4.
The 1943 Adapazarı–Hendek earthquake occurred at 17:32 local time on 20 June, in Sakarya Province, Turkey. It registered an estimated 6.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale with a maximum intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1943 Alahan Panjang earthquakes occurred on June 8 and June 9 UTC (June 9, 1943 local time) in Sumatra, then under Japanese occupation. This was an earthquake doublet (the shocks occurred at the same location on consecutive days).The first mainshock occurred on June 8 at 20:42 UTC. It ruptured the Suliti segment of the Sumatran Fault Zone. The magnitude was given as Mw 7.2, or Ms 7.1.The second mainshock occurred on June 9 at 03:06 UTC. It ruptured the Sumani segment of the Sumatran Fault Zone and perhaps the northwestern part of the Suliti segment. The magnitude was given as Mw 7.5, or Ms 7.4.Alahan Panjang was damaged in the earthquakes. Right lateral offsets were reported near the town of Solok.Near the Sumani segment, earthquake doublets occurred repeatedly. Similar earthquake doublet nearby include the earthquakes in 1926 and 2007.
The 1943 Central Java earthquake occurred on July 23 at 14:53:10 UTC with a moment magnitude of 7.0 near Java, which was under Japanese occupation.
The 1943 Tosya–Ladik earthquake occurred at 00:20 local time on 26 November, near Tosya, Kastamonu Province, in northern Turkey. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum felt intensity of between IX–X (Violent to Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 2,824 deaths.
The Tottori earthquake (鳥取地震, Tottori jishin) occurred in Tottori prefecture, Japan at 17:36 local time on September 10, 1943. Although the earthquake occurred during World War II, information about the disaster was surprisingly uncensored, and relief volunteers and supplies came from many parts of the Japanese empire, including Manchukuo.The Tottori earthquake had its epicenter offshore from Ketaka District, now part of Tottori, and registered a magnitude of 7.2 on the Richter scale. The seismic intensity was recorded as 6 in Tottori city, and 5 as far away as Okayama on the Inland Sea. The center of Tottori city, with many antiquated buildings was the hardest hit, with an estimated 80% of its structures damaged or destroyed. As the earthquake struck in the evening when most kitchens had fires lit in preparation for the evening meal, fires broke out in 16 locations around the city. With water mains damaged, citizens formed bucket brigades to prevent fires from spreading; however, the death toll was 1083 killed, including numerous Zainichi Koreans working in the nearby Aragane Copper Mines.Two magnitude 6.2 earthquakes had occurred in the same area earlier that year on March 4 and 5, but did not do significant damage.
The 1944 Bolu–Gerede earthquake occurred at 05:22 local time on 1 February. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.2 and a maximum felt intensity of IX–X (Violent–Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1944 Cornwall–Massena earthquake occurred on September 5 at 12:38:45 am EDT in Massena, New York. It registered 5.8 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). This area is part of the Saint Lawrence River Valley and the seismically active zone known as the Saint Lawrence rift system. The earthquake is the largest known in New York's recorded history and was felt over a great distances.
The 1944 San Juan earthquake took place in the province of San Juan, in the center-west area of Argentina, a region highly prone to seismic events. This moderate to strong earthquake (estimated moment magnitudes range from 6.7 to 7.8) destroyed a large part of San Juan, the provincial capital, and killed 10,000 of its inhabitants, 10% of its population at the time. One third of the province population became homeless. It is acknowledged as the worst natural disaster in Argentine history.The earthquake occurred at 8:52 pm on 15 January 1944 and had its epicenter located 30 km north of the provincial capital, near La Laja in Albardón Department. Some 90% of the buildings in the city were destroyed and those left standing suffered such damage that in most cases they had to be demolished. It is considered that the reason for such widespread destruction was the low quality of construction, rather than just the power of the earthquake.In 1944 many of San Juan's houses were made of adobe and the reconstruction programme prompted the creation of a building code that took into account contemporary knowledge of earthquakes and their effect on buildings. Stronger bricks were used, concrete single-story houses were erected and sidewalks and streets were made wider.
The 1944 Tōnankai earthquake occurred at 13:35 local time (04:35 UTC) on 7 December. It had an estimated magnitude of 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of greater than 5 shindo (about VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale). It triggered a large tsunami that caused serious damage along the coast of Wakayama Prefecture and the Tōkai region. Together the earthquake and tsunami caused 1,223 casualties.
The 1945 Balochistan earthquake (Urdu: بلوچستان زلزلہ‎) occurred in British India at 5:26 PST on 28 November 1945 with a moment magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.
The 1945 Mikawa earthquake (三河地震, Mikawa jishin) was an earthquake which occurred off Aichi prefecture, Japan at 03:38 AM on January 13, 1945. As the earthquake occurred during World War II, information about the disaster was censored, and efforts at keeping the disaster secret hampered relief efforts and contributed to a high death toll.
The 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake occurred near the Aleutian Islands, Alaska on April 1. The shock had a moment magnitude of 8.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong). It resulted in 165–173 casualties and over $26 million in damage. The seafloor along the fault was elevated, triggering a Pacific-wide tsunami with multiple destructive waves at heights ranging from 45–130 ft. The tsunami obliterated the Scotch Cap Lighthouse on Unimak Island, Alaska among others, and killed all five lighthouse keepers. Despite the destruction to the Aleutian Island Unimak, the tsunami had almost an imperceptible effect on the Alaskan mainland. The wave reached Kauai, Hawaii 4.5 hours after the quake, and Hilo, Hawaii 4.9 hours later. These Hawaiian natives were caught completely off-guard by the onset of the tsunami due to the inability to transmit any warnings from the destroyed posts at Scotch Cap. The effects of the tsunami also reached the West Coast of the United States.The tsunami was unusually powerful for the size of the earthquake. The event was classified as a tsunami earthquake due to the discrepancy between the size of the tsunami and the relatively low surface wave magnitude. The large-scale destruction prompted the creation of the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System, which later became the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in 1949.
The 1946 Dominican Republic earthquake occurred on August 4 at 17:51 UTC near Samaná, Dominican Republic. The mainshock measured 8.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale and an aftershock occurred four days later on August 8 at 13.28 UTC with a magnitude of 7.6. A tsunami was generated by the initial earthquake and caused widespread devastation across Hispaniola. The tsunami was observed in much of the Caribbean and the southern Atlantic ocean.
The 1946 Hsinhua earthquake (Chinese: 1946年新化大地震; pinyin: 1946 nián Xīnhuà dà dìzhèn), also referred to as the 1946 Tainan earthquake (Chinese: 1946年台南大地震; pinyin: 1946 nián Táinán dà dìzhèn) was a magnitude 6.1 earthquake which hit Tainan County (now part of Tainan City), Taiwan, on December 5, 1946 at 06:47. The quake claimed 74 lives and was the eighth deadliest earthquake in twentieth century Taiwan.
The 1946 Nankai earthquake (南海地震 Nankai jishin) was a great earthquake in Nankaidō, Japan. It occurred on December 21, 1946 at 04:19 JST (December 20, 19:19 UTC). The earthquake measured between 8.1 and 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale, and was felt from Northern Honshū to Kyūshū. It occurred almost two years after the 1944 Tōnankai earthquake, which ruptured the adjacent part of the Nankai megathrust.
The 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake occurred with a moment magnitude of 7.3 that struck Vancouver Island, on the Coast of British Columbia, Canada, at 10:15 a.m. on Sunday, June 23. The main shock epicentre occurred in the Forbidden Plateau area northwest of Courtenay. While most of the large earthquakes in the Vancouver area occur at tectonic plate boundaries, the 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake was a crustal event. Shaking was felt from Portland, Oregon to Prince Rupert, British Columbia. This is one of the most damaging earthquakes in the history of British Columbia, but damage was restricted because there were no heavily populated areas near the epicentre, where severe shaking occurred.This earthquake is Canada's largest historic onshore earthquake. However, the greatest earthquake in Canadian history recorded by seismometers was the 1949 Queen Charlotte earthquake, an interplate earthquake that occurred on the ocean bottom just off the rugged coast of Graham Island, which reached magnitude 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 1946 Varto–Hınıs earthquake occurred at 05:12 local time on 31 May. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 5.9 and a maximum felt intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing between 800 and 1300 casualties.
The 1947 Assam earthquake occurred on July 29 at 13:43 UTC with a magnitude of Mw 7.3. The earthquake was located near the border between British India and the Republic of China, which has then not controlled Tibet. Some sources put the epicenter in the Indian-controlled side, and some put it in the Chinese-controlled side. In the Chinese literature, this earthquake was often located around the Nang County, Tibet.In Dibrugarh, Jorhat, and Tezpur, there were cracks in walls. Failure of electricity was reported in Guwahati. The released seismic moment was about 1.5×1020 Nm. The mechanism of the earthquake is not well known.
The 1947 Gisborne earthquakes and tsunami occurred east of Gisborne, offshore New Zealand's North Island. Both earthquakes are estimated to have measured at most 7.1 on the Moment Magnitude scale. The first earthquake, which struck offshore Poverty Bay on 26 March is estimated to have been between 7–7.1MW, and generated a tsunami with a maximum measured run up height of 10 meters. The tsunami caused widespread damage along the north-east coast of the North Island, but was not observed outside of New Zealand. Seven weeks later, a second earthquake struck offshore Tolaga Bay on 17 May, and was estimated to have been between 6.9–7.1MW. It also generated a tsunami, with a maximum measured run up height of 6 meters. Despite occurring at low tide and being less powerful the second time around, the tsunami caused small amounts of damage along the east coast and is noted for washing away construction materials ironically being used to repair damage from the previous tsunami. No one died in either of the 1947 tsunamis, but the toll could have been high had they struck during summer holidays, when the beaches are crowded.
The 1947 Wisconsin earthquake took place on May 6, immediately south of Milwaukee at 15:25 (CST). It was the largest tremor to be historically documented in Wisconsin, but it was not recorded by seismographs.
The 1948 Ashgabat earthquake occurred on 6 October with a surface wave magnitude of 7.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The shock occurred in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic near Ashgabat. Due to censorship by the national (Turkmen) government, the event was not widely reported in the USSR's media. Historians tend to agree that the ban on reporting the extent of the casualties and damage did not allow the central Soviet government to allocate enough financial resources to adequately respond.
The 1948 Desert Hot Springs earthquake occurred on December 4 at 3:43 p.m. Pacific Standard Time with a Richter magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock was felt from the central coast of California in the north, and to Baja California in the south, and came at a time when earthquake research in southern California was being resumed following the Second World War. It was one of two events in the 20th century that have occurred near a complex region of the southern San Andreas Fault System where it traverses the San Gorgonio Pass and the northern Coachella Valley. Damage was not severe, but some serious injuries occurred, and aftershocks continued until 1957.
The 1948 Fukui earthquake (福井地震, Fukui jishin) occurred in Fukui Prefecture, Japan. The magnitude 6.8 quake struck at 5:13:31 p.m.(JDT) on June 28. The strongest shaking occurred in the city of Fukui, where it was recorded as 6 (equivalent to the current 7) on the Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale. The shock occurred near the town of Maruoka.
The 1948 Lady Caycay earthquake occurred with a surface wave magnitude of 8.2 at 01:46 PST (UTC+08:00) on 25 January 1948. The epicenter was between the municipalities of Anini-y, Antique and Dao (present-day Tobias Fornier in Antique) on Panay Island, Philippines.The earthquake was the second biggest on record in the country as it caused widespread damage in Panay and nearby islands. However, accounts of its intensity and the tsunamis it generated are sparse, possibly because the earthquake struck as the Philippines was recovering from the effects of the Second World War.
The 1948 Litang earthquake (1948年理塘地震) occurred on May 25 at 07:11 UTC. It was located near Litang, China. Now situated in the Sichuan Province, Litang County was then called Lihua (or Lihwa) (理化) County and belonged to the defunct Xikang (or Sikang) Province. The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 7.2, or Ms 7.3.This earthquake caused more than 800 deaths. More than 600 houses collapsed in the areas around Litang and Daocheng. Landslides, ground fissures and sandblows occurred in the region. The intensity of the earthquake reached MM X. Some of the aftershocks caused additional damage.The earthquake occurred in the middle segment between Litang and Dewu (德巫) of the Litang-Dewu fault zone (理塘-德巫断裂带). Litang Fault, situated in the Sichuan-Yunnan rhombic block (川滇菱形块体), is a NW-trending fault and dominated mainly by left-lateral shear movement. The average horizontal slip rate of the Litang Fault is about 3.2 to 4.4 mm/yr on the Litang-Dewu segment and about 2.6 to 3.0 mm/yr on the segment to the north of Litang. A study of Wang et al. estimated that the Litang fault has a left-lateral strike-slip rate of 4.4±1.3 mm/yr and an extension rate of 2.7±1.1 mm/yr. The focal mechanism was recognized to be a left-lateral slip on a plane striking northwest (315°) for a distance of about 75 km. The released seismic moment was estimated to be about 7.4×1019 Nm.
The 1948 Salta earthquake took place in the Argentinian province of Salta on 25 August at 03:09:28 local time The shock was 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Property damage and casualties occurred in several towns in the east and southeast of Salta, and also in northern Tucumán and Jujuy, affecting the capitals of both. It was the last major earthquake recorded in the Argentine Northwest until the 2010 Salta earthquake.
The 1949 Ambato earthquake was the largest earthquake in the Western Hemisphere in more than five years. On August 5, 1949, it struck Ecuador's Tungurahua Province southeast of its capital Ambato and killed 5,050 people. Measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale it originated from a hypocenter 40 km (25 mi) beneath the surface. The nearby villages of Guano, Patate, Pelileo, and Pillaro were destroyed, and the city of Ambato suffered heavy damage. The earthquake flattened entire buildings, and subsequent landslides caused damage throughout the Tungurahua, Chimborazo, and Cotopaxi Provinces. It disrupted water mains and communication lines and opened a fissure into which the small town of Libertad sank. Moderate shaking from the event extended as far away as Quito and Guayaquil.Earthquakes in Ecuador stem from two major interrelated tectonic areas: the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and the Andean Volcanic Belt. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter-Andean Valley which were created by the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shockwaves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both interplate and intraplate seismicity.
The 1949 Karlıova earthquake occurred at 18:43 UTC on 17 August with an epicenter near Karlıova in Bingöl Province, Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.7, a maximum felt intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and caused 320 casualties.
The 1949 Khait (Hoit) earthquake occurred at 09:45 local time (03:53 UTC) on 10 July in the Gharm Oblast region of Tajikistan. It had a magnitude of 7.5 and triggered a series of landslides that together led to 7,200 deaths.
The Khait or Hoit landslide occurred on July 10, 1949 in the Hoit district in the Gharm Oblast in the Tajikistan, then part of the Soviet Union. 'Khait' is a transliteration from Russian: Хаит; local modern spelling: Hoit (Tajik: Ҳоит).The landslide was triggered by the 1949 Khait earthquake and buried 33 villages and has by some estimates killed 28,000 people. News of the landslide was not publicly revealed by the government and details of the disaster were not revealed until after the fall of the Soviet Union. A marble statue of a woman with her head and hands lowered and an expression of grief was later erected at the site.
The 1949 Olympia earthquake occurred on April 13 at 12:55:44 local time with a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe). The shock was located in the area between Olympia and Tacoma, and was felt throughout the state, as well as parts of Oregon, British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana. It is the largest recorded earthquake to occur in the Puget Sound region of Washington. Eight people were killed and many were injured.
The 1949 Queen Charlotte Islands earthquake struck the sparsely populated Queen Charlotte Islands and the Pacific Northwest coast at 8:01 p.m. PDT on August 21. The shock had a surface wave magnitude of 8.1 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe).The interplate earthquake began in the ocean bottom just off the rugged coast of Graham Island. It ruptured along the Queen Charlotte Fault both northward and southward more than 500 km (311 mi). Shaking was felt throughout British Columbia, parts of Washington, Oregon, Alberta, the Yukon, and Alaska. No deaths were reported in this earthquake.
The 1949 Tierra del Fuego earthquake occurred on the island of Tierra del Fuego on 17 December at 06:53:30. Its epicenter was located in the east of the Chilean Tierra del Fuego Province, close to the Argentine border, at a depth of 30 km (19 mi).It reached 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale and was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the south of Argentina and one of the most powerful in austral Chile. It was felt with intensities as high as VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and affected the settlements of Punta Arenas and Río Gallegos.
The 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake, also known as the Assam earthquake, occurred on August 15, the third Independence Day of India, and had a moment magnitude of 8.6. The epicentre was located near Rima, Tibet. The earthquake was destructive in both Assam and Tibet, and between 1,500 and 3,300 people were killed.It was the 6th largest earthquake of the 20th century. It is also the largest known earthquake to have not been caused by an oceanic subduction. Instead, this quake was caused by two continental plates colliding.
The 1951 East Rift Valley earthquakes (Chinese: 1951年縱谷地震系列; pinyin: 1951 nián Zònggǔ dìzhèn xìliè) were a series of 735 earthquakes which struck eastern Taiwan from October 22, 1951 to December 5, 1951, four of which registered over 7 on the Richter Scale, the largest of those being two magnitude 7.3 quakes on October 22 and November 25. Altogether the quakes killed 85 people.
The 1951 Kurşunlu earthquake occurred at 18:33 GMT (20:33 local time) on 13 August near Kurşunlu, Çankırı Province, Central Anatolia Region, Turkey. The earthquake was one of a series of major and intermediate quakes that have occurred in modern times along the North Anatolian Fault since 1939.It had a magnitude of 6.9 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. There were 50 casualties and 3,354 injuries.
The 1952 Hokkaido earthquake, which occurred at 10:22:41 local time on 4 March in the sea near Tokachi District, Hokkaidō, had a magnitude of 8.1 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 1952 Hasankale earthquake occurred at 08:03 local time on 3 January in Hasankale (today Pasinler) in Erzurum Province, Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum felt intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 41 casualties. This spot has been the subject of studies due to the amount of earthquakes that occur in Turkey. 17% of earthquakes, globally, occur in this area. This is because the Alpide belt crosses through Turkey. The earthquakes are cause when the plates try to slide past each other on a transform boundary.
The 1952 Kern County earthquake occurred on July 21 in the southern San Joaquin Valley and measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale. The main shock occurred at 4:52 am Pacific Daylight Time (11:52 UTC), killed 12 people and injured hundreds, and caused an estimated $60 million in property damage. A small sector of damage near Bealville corresponded to a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme), though this intensity rating was not representative of the majority of damage. The earthquake occurred on the White Wolf Fault near the community of Wheeler Ridge and was the strongest to occur in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.The town of Tehachapi suffered the greatest damage and loss of life from the earthquake, though other locations in Kern County experienced significant damage as well, but its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern California. The July mainshock had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into July and August with many magnitude 5+ events with intensities of V (Moderate) to VII (Very strong). Six of these aftershocks occurred on the day of the mainshock, but the strongest aftershock came on August 22 as a M5.8 event that had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) and resulted in the deaths of two people and caused an additional $10 million in property damage.Following the event, a field survey was conducted along the fault zone with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.
The 1952 San Juan earthquake took place on 11 June at 00:31:37 UTC in the province of San Juan, Argentina. It measured 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale with a depth of 30 kilometers (19 mi). The earthquake was felt in San Juan with a maximum of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused damage in some locations in the south and west of the province, and a small number of casualties.
The 1952 Severo-Kurilsk Tsunami was a major tsunami that hit Severo-Kurilsk, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Oblast, Russian SFSR, USSR, which occurred on 5 November 1952 at about 5 a.m. It led to the destruction of many settlements in Sakhalin Oblast and Kamchatka Oblast, while the main impact struck the town of Severo-Kurilsk.The tsunami was generated by a major earthquake in the Pacific Ocean, 130 kilometers (81 mi) from the shore of Kamchatka, with an estimated magnitude of 9.0. There were three waves about 15–18 meters (49–59 ft) high. After the earthquake the majority of the Severo-Kurilsk citizens fled to the surrounding hills, where they escaped the first wave. However, most of them returned to the town and were killed by the second wave. The third wave was minor. According to the authorities, out of a population of 6,000 people, 2,336 died. The remaining survivors were evacuated to continental Russia. The settlement was then rebuilt in another location.
This is a list of earthquakes in 1953. Only magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquakes appear on the list. Lower magnitude events are included if they have caused death, injury or damage. All dates are listed according to UTC time. This was a fairly active year. There were no great quakes above magnitude 8.0+ as experienced in previous years. Magnitude 7.0+ quakes numbered 13 in all. Japan led the way in magnitude terms. Other large quakes struck Chile, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Turkey. The quakes with the most human casualties were in Turkey, Iran and Greece with the vast majority of the death toll coming from these events.
The 1953 Suva earthquake occurred on September 14 at 00:26 UTC near Suva, Fiji, just off the southeast shore of Viti Levu. This earthquake had a magnitude of Ms 6.8. The earthquake triggered a coral reef platform collapse and a submarine landslide that caused a tsunami. Eight people were reported killed; a wharf, bridges, and buildings were severely damaged in Suva.
The 1953 Torud earthquake occurred at the northeastern border of the Great Salt Kavir in Torud, Semnan, Iran on 12 February. The shock had a moment magnitude of 6.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). At least 800 people were killed.
The 1953 Bay of Plenty earthquake struck the upper North Island on September 29 at 1:36 pm. With a depth of 273 km, it is one of the deepest earthquakes recorded in New Zealand. Shaking was felt as far south as northern Otago. Recorded intensities from the tremor reached VI (Strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale in eastern Bay of Plenty and northern Hawke's Bay.
The 1953 Concepción earthquake occurred on May 6 at 17:16 UTC (13:16 local time). The epicenter was located offshore Biobío Region, Chile. It had a magnitude of Ms 7.6, or ML 7.6. Twelve people were reported dead in this earthquake.In Concepción, 15% of the buildings were damaged. Electricity and gas were not effected. However, the electricity service was suspended as a precaution.In Chillán, the intensity reached MM X. Many houses were destroyed. The electricity, telegraph, and telephone services were interrupted.In Tomé, several houses were damaged, and many families stayed in the open.This earthquake was located close to the 1939 Chillán earthquake. However, the focal mechanism of the 1953 Concepción earthquake was reverse faulting, while that of the 1939 Chillán earthquake was normal faulting. It was not clear whether the 1953 Concepción earthquake was an interplate or intraplate earthquake.
The 1953 Ionian earthquake (also known as the Great Kefalonia earthquake) struck the southern Ionian Islands in Greece on August 12. In mid-August there were over 113 recorded earthquakes in the region between Kefalonia and Zakynthos, and the most destructive was the August 12 earthquake. The event measured 7.2 on the surface wave magnitude scale, and it raised up the whole island of Kefalonia by 60 cm (24 in), and caused widespread damage throughout the islands of Kefalonia and Zakynthos.
The 1953 Tumbes earthquake occurred on December 12 at 12:31:29 local time near the border between Peru and Ecuador. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.5, a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VIII (Severe), and occurred in the northwestern offshore area of Tumbes, Peru.
The 1953 Yenice–Gönen earthquake occurred at 21:06 local time (19:06 UTC on 18 March in the province of Çanakkale and Balıkesir in the Marmara Region at western Turkey. It had a magnitude 7.5 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused widespread damage, killing 1,070 and causing damage that was estimated at US$3,570,000 repair value.
The 1954 Chlef earthquake struck Chlef Province in Algeria on September 9 at 02:04:43 local time. The shock measured 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). It destroyed Chlef, then named Orléansville, leaving at least 1,243 people dead and 5,000 injured. Damage was estimated at $6 million. It was followed by multiple aftershocks. Algeria faces annual earthquakes and has undergone several changes to its earthquake building codes since its first earthquake engineering regulations from 1717.
Dixie Valley, Nevada, was a small ranching town in Churchill County, Nevada until the area was acquired in 1995 by the US Navy for the Fallon Range Training Complex (FRTC). The town had no retail businesses, most residents were more than a mile from their nearest neighbor, and a 1-room school (grades 1-8) was the teacher's residence and served as a meeting, dance, & election hall (grades 9-12 were bussed 75 miles to Fallon, Nevada). The abandoned town of Dixie was established at the head of Dixie Valley in 1861 and named by Southern sympathizers. The medium-sized Dixie Valley geothermal power plant (1988, 66 megawatts) employs ~30 people and has 12 production steam wells and ~24 injection wells.
The 1954 Adelaide earthquake had its center at Darlington, some 12 km (7.5 mi) to the south of Adelaide in South Australia. It took place at 03.40 in the early morning of 1 March 1954 and had a reported magnitude of 5.6. The quake is thought to have started along the Eden-Burnside fault line, which is essentially the Hills face zone, at a depth of 4 km although, due to lack of instruments, this is uncertain.As Australia lies in the middle of a tectonic plate, South Australia is relatively stable geologically, however, South Australia is the second most earthquake prone of the Australian states with around 3-4 tremors every day. Most are, however, of a magnitude below 2.5 noteworthy only to seismologists, and since they are dispersed fairly evenly across the state, most take place well away from centers of human population. The 1954 Adelaide earthquake was different because of its magnitude, which made it the fourth most intense earthquake reported in the state since settlement in 1836, and because it took place in an area of dense human settlement, under a suburb of the state capital, Adelaide.
The 1955 Alexandria earthquake occurred on September 12 at 06:09 UTC. The epicenter was located in the eastern Mediterranean, offshore of Alexandria, Egypt. The earthquake had a magnitude of Ms 6.3.Damage was reported in the Nile Delta between Alexandria and Cairo. About 300 adobe houses were badly damaged around Lake Idku. The earthquake caused 18 deaths and 89 injuries, with 40 houses completely collapsed and about 420 houses ruined. The earthquake could also be felt in Cyprus, Palestine, Syria, and Greece.
The 1955 Yuzha earthquake (1955年鱼鲊地震) occurred on September 23, 1955 at 15:06 UTC (23:06 local time). The epicenter was located in the area around Lazha (拉鲊), Dalongtan (大龙潭) Township, Renhe District, Panzhihua and Yuzha (鱼鲊) Township, Huili County. Lazha then belonged to Yongren County, Yunnan and now within Sichuan. Yuzha then belonged to Huili County, Sichuan as it still does. The earthquake had a magnitude of Ms 6.8.728 people were reported dead and 1547 injured in the earthquake. More than 15000 rooms collapsed. 8 people died and 7 houses collapsed in the Xigeda (昔格达) Village. Cracks ranging from 10 to 70 cm in width and 100 to 1,500 m in length occurred on hillsides and ridges. Landslides were observed along both banks of the Jinsha River. A lot of villages on both banks of the Jinsha River were destroyed. Rivers and springs dried up, and lots of new springs appeared. Changes of water level in wells and ditches were reported. A lot of villages on both banks of the Jinsha River were destroyed. Along the Jinsha River and its surrounding gullies, large quantities of rocks broke, fell, and dammed up the gullies. In the Jinsha River, waves surged 1 m high. The maximum intensity reached MM IX. The shaking could be felt as far as about 400 km away.The Xigeda-Yuanmou fault (昔格达—元谋断裂带), about 270 km long, is the seismogenic structure of this earthquake. From the distribution of the isoseismals of this earthquake, it was suggested that there is a three-layered structure. There is a rupture layer, and there are two complete rock layers located in both sides of the rupture layer. The rupture layer is the place where the stress was concentrated and released and has the role of reflecting the seismic wave propagation.
The 1956 Amorgos earthquake occurred at 03:11 UTC on July 9. It had a magnitude of 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicentre was to the south of the island of Amorgos, the easternmost island of the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea. There was significant damage on Amorgos and the neighbouring island of Santorini. It was the largest earthquake in Greece in the 20th century. It was followed 13 minutes later by a magnitude 7.2 earthquake near Santorini. It triggered a major tsunami with a maximum run-up of 30 m. The combined effects of the earthquake shaking and the tsunami caused the deaths of 53 people with a further 100 injured.
The 1956 Anjar earthquake occurred at 15:32 UTC on 21 July, which caused maximum damage in town of Anjar in Kutch, Gujarat, India. It had an estimated magnitude of 6.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1956 Chim earthquake was a destructive multiple-shock event that occurred on March 16 in Lebanon along a strand of the Dead Sea Transform (DST) fault system. The epicenter was located in the south of Lebanon in the Chouf District. Six thousand homes were destroyed and another 17,000 were damaged. The number of persons killed was 136.
The 1956 Nicaragua earthquake occurred on October 24 at 14:42 UTC. The epicenter was located west of Masachapa, Managua Department, Nicaragua. It was an earthquake of magnitude Ms 7.3, or Mw7.2. Building damage was reported in Managua. A study of W. Montero P. shows that this earthquake might be related to the earthquake of Nicoya Peninsula on October 5, 1950. A tsunami was triggered by the earthquake.
The 1956 Sagaing earthquake occurred on July 16, 1956 at 15:07 UTC. The earthquake was located near Sagaing, Burma. This earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 7.1.38 people died because of the earthquake. Several pagodas, including the Mingun Pagoda, were severely damaged. The earthquake was close to the Shan-Sagaing Fault. However, the focal mechanism remains undetermined. The intensity reached MM VIII to MM IX near the epicenter.
The 1957 San Francisco earthquake (also known as the Daly City earthquake of 1957) occurred on March 22 at 11:44:22 local time with a moment magnitude of 5.7 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock was located in Northern California in the vicinity of the San Andreas Fault. There was both a foreshock and aftershock sequence that lasted through the month of June. Damage was considered minimal, but financial losses amounted to around US$1 million.
The 1957 Abant earthquake occurred at 08:33 on 26 May. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing 52 casualties.
The 1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake took place on March 9 with a moment magnitude of 8.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). It occurred south of the Andreanof Islands group, which is part of the Aleutian Islands arc. The event occurred along the Aleutian Trench, the convergent plate boundary that separates the Pacific Plate and the North American Plates near Alaska. A basin wide tsunami followed, with effects felt in Alaska and Hawaii. Total losses were around $5 million.
The 1957 Mongolia earthquake occurred on December 4. The earthquake resulted in thirty deaths, and the destruction of all houses in Dzun Bogd and Bayan Gobi. Subsidence, faulting and fissures occurred in the Bahar Uula and Ih Bogd Uul Mountains. The largest fissure was 250 km (160 mi) long with as much as 9–11 m (30–36 ft) of vertical and 3 m (9.8 ft) of horizontal offset. Because of the extremely sparse population in the area, this is perhaps the least damaging great earthquake to have occurred on land in the 20th Century.
The 1958 Ecuador–Colombia earthquake struck the coastal regions of Ecuador and Colombia on January 19 with a surface wave magnitude of 7.6 at 9:09 local time. Approximately 30 percent of Esmeraldas (Ecuador) was destroyed, including the children's department of the hospital, where three children died. In all, 111 persons died and 45 were injured as a result of the earthquake. Water mains were broken and power transmission lines were damaged. The Esmeraldas-Quito highway collapsed at many places. Many other roads of the country were made impassable by cracks and fallen trees. According to press reports, a landslide from the slopes of the Andes at Panado village buried a hundred people. The earthquake was destructive in the cities on the northern coast of the country and was strong from Latacunga to Quito, Ibarra and Tulcán. It was felt at Guayaquil.
The 1958 Lituya Bay megatsunami occurred on July 9 at 10:15:58 p.m., following an earthquake with a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of XI (Extreme). The earthquake took place on the Fairweather Fault and triggered a rockslide of 30 million cubic metres (40 million cubic yards, and about 90 million tons) to fall from several hundred metres into the narrow inlet of Lituya Bay, Alaska. The impact was heard 50 miles (80 km) away, and the sudden displacement of water resulted in a megatsunami that destroyed vegetation up to 1,722 feet (525 m) above the height of the bay and a wave that traveled across the bay with a crest reported by witnesses to be on the order of 98 feet (30 m) in height. This is the most significant megatsunami and the largest known in modern times. The event forced a re-evaluation of large wave events, and recognition of impact, rockfall and landslide events as a previously unknown cause of very large waves.A 2010 model examined the amount of infill on the floor of the bay, which was many times larger than that of the rockfall alone, and also the energy and height of the waves, and the accounts given by eyewitnesses, concluded that there had been a "dual slide" involving a rockfall, which also triggered a release of 5 to 10 times its volume of sediment trapped by the adjacent Lituya Glacier, as an almost immediate and many times larger second slide, a ratio comparable with other events where this "dual slide" effect is known to have happened.Lituya Bay has a history of megatsunami events in modern times — the 1958 event is one of many evidenced, but due to its remoteness was the first for which sufficient data was captured at the time, to confirm the nature of the event.
The 1959 Hengchun earthquake (Chinese: 1959年恆春地震; pinyin: 1959 nián Héngchūn dìzhèn) struck the southern tip of Taiwan on August 15 with a Richter magnitude 7.1. It was the tenth deadliest earthquake in twentieth century Taiwan, killing 16 or 17 people.
The 1959 Kamchatka earthquake occurred on May 4 at 19:15 p.m. with a moment magnitude of 8.0, and a surface wave magnitude of 8.2. The epicenter was near the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russian SFSR, USSR. Building damage was reported in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The maximum intensity was VIII (Damaging) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The intensity in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky was about VIII MSK.The earthquake triggered a tsunami with .2 meters (7.9 in) of runup that was recorded in Massacre Bay, Alaska, in the United States. Subduction is active along about the southern half of the eastern coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, between its junctions with the Aleutian Islands and the Kuril Islands.
The 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake also known as the 1959 Yellowstone earthquake occurred on August 17 at 11:37 pm (MST) in southwestern Montana, United States. The earthquake measured 7.3 – 7.5 on the Richter magnitude scale, and caused a huge landslide that caused over 28 fatalities and left $11 million (1959 US$, $88.7 million 2014 US$) in damage. The slide blocked the flow of the Madison River resulting in the creation of Quake Lake. Effects of the earthquake were also felt in Idaho and Wyoming.The 1959 quake was the strongest and deadliest earthquake to hit Montana since the 1935-36 Helena earthquakes left 4 people dead. It also caused the worst landslides in the history of the Northwestern United States since 1927.
The 1960 Agadir earthquake occurred 29 February at 23:40 Western European Time (UTC+00:00). Agadir is located in western Morocco on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite the earthquake's moderate magnitude of 5.7, its maximum perceived intensity was X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. Between 12,000 and 15,000 people (about a third of the city's population of the time) were killed and another 12,000 injured with at least 35,000 people left homeless, making it the most destructive and deadliest earthquake in Moroccan history. Particularly hard hit was the Talbordjt area. The earthquake's shallow focus, close proximity to the port city of Agadir, and unsatisfactory construction methods were all reasons declared by earthquake engineers and seismologists as to why it was so destructive.
The 1960 Concepción earthquakes were a succession of three destructive earthquakes that happened between 21 and 22 May, 1960. They formed part of the foreshock sequence for the 1960 Valdivia earthquake, the largest recorded earthquake in history.The first was on May 21 at 06:02 UTC-4. Its epicenter was west of Curanilahue, Bío Bío Region, Chile, and its magnitude was 8.1  or 8.3MW and 7.3 or 7.5MS. This earthquake, which lasted 35 seconds, destroyed a third of the buildings in the city of Concepción.The second happened on May 22 at 06:32 UTC-4. Its epicenter was east of Curanilahue, Bío Bío Region, Chile, and its magnitude was 7.3 MS  or 6.8 Mw.The third happened the same day at 14:55 UTC-4. Its magnitude was 7.8 MS or 7.9 Mw. This earthquake happened 15 minutes before the 1960 Valdivia earthquake.
The November 1960 Peru earthquake occurred offshore northern Peru on November 20 at 17:02 local time. The magnitude of the earthquake was put at Ms 6.75 by using the conventional magnitude measurement within a shorter duration of ~20 s. However, there is a large discrepancy between the magnitudes in Ms and Mw in this earthquake. The discrepancy was resulted from that the earthquake had a long source duration of about 130 s, and by calculating the seismic moment, the magnitude would be Mw 7.6 or Mw 7.8, according to different sources. This earthquake belongs to a category of earthquakes with slow rupture velocities and potential of producing tsunamis larger than those expected from the moment magnitudes.This earthquake triggered a tsunami with a height of 9 meters (30 ft) in Puerto Eten, Lambayeque Department. The tsunami caused damage along the coast of the Lambayeque department. Three deaths were reported in Lambayeque Department. Thirteen deaths and 50 missing were reported in Guañape Islands, La Libertad Department. The tsunami was also observed in Japan.
The 1960 Valdivia earthquake (Spanish: Terremoto de Valdivia) or Great Chilean earthquake (Gran terremoto de Chile) of 22 May is the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. Various studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude scale. It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted approximately 10 minutes. The resulting tsunami affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia and the Aleutian Islands.The epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco (see map), approximately 570 kilometres (350 mi) south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres (82 ft). The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii. Waves as high as 10.7 metres (35 ft) were recorded 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) from the epicenter, and as far away as Japan and the Philippines.The death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain. Various estimates of the total number of fatalities from the earthquake and tsunamis have been published, ranging between 1,000 and 6,000 killed. Different sources have estimated the monetary cost ranged from US$400 million to 800 million (or $3.2 billion to $6.4 billion today, adjusted for inflation).
The 1961 New South Wales earthquake occurred on May 22, 1961, in New South Wales, Australia. Reaching a magnitude of 5.5 and causing significant structural damage in a wide area.The earthquake was felt from the Snowy Mountains to Newcastle, Dubbo, and Narrandera. An estimated area of 50,000 square miles. In the area of Moss Vale, Robertson, and Bowral, the earthquake caused significant structural damage to buildings. While rockfalls blocked the Macquarie Pass. Sydney suffered minimal damage from the earthquake itself, though the tremors and resulting power failures caused "considerable alarm".Seismograms from Riverview were used to estimate the magnitude of the earthquake. There were only three known earthquakes of comparable magnitude prior to this one. Occurring respectively in 1930, 1934, and 1938.
The 1962 Buin Zahra earthquake occurred on September 1 in the area of Buin Zahra, Qazvin Province, Iran. The shock had a Richter magnitude of 7.1 and resulted in 12,225 fatalities. Qazvin Province lies in an area of Iran that experiences large earthquakes. The 1962 event originated on one of many faults in the area, called the Ipak Fault. Believed to have been reactivated multiple times, the fault is extensive and could still pose a threat to locals. Iran's building codes, renowned for performing poorly during earthquakes, were recently evaluated by multiple world organizations. Most hope that the Iranian government will implement a better quality of design, highlighting that Iran is among the most seismically active countries in the world.
The 1963 Kuril Islands earthquake occurred at 05:17 UTC, on October 13. The earthquake had a magnitude of 8.5 and was followed by a Mw=7.8 event seven days later. Both earthquakes triggered tsunamis that were observed around the northern part of the Pacific ocean.
The 1963 Skopje earthquake (Macedonian: Скопски земјотрес 1963, transliterated Skopski zemjotres 1963) was a 6.1 moment magnitude earthquake which occurred in Skopje, SR Macedonia (present-day Republic of Macedonia) then part of the SFR Yugoslavia, on July 26, 1963 which killed over 1,070 people, injured between 3,000 and 4,000 and left more than 200,000 people homeless. About 80 percent of the city was destroyed.
The 1963 Su-ao earthquake occurred on February 13 at 16:50 local time (08:50 UTC). The epicenter was located off the coast of Taiwan, near Su-ao, Yilan County. It had a magnitude of Mw 7.3. Three people were reported dead. A landslide occurred in the Su-ao-Hualien highway. The earthquake showed a weakly coupled interplate boundary in the nearby region.
The 1964 Rosais earthquake (Portuguese: Crise sísmica dos Rosais) was a series of seismic swarms occurring in February 1964, leading to two major earthquakes on the 15 and 21 of February, resulting in the destruction of most of the habitable dwellings on the western part of the island of São Jorge, in the archipelago of the Azores. The event resulted in the evacuation of approximately 5,000 residents from that island to Terceira, Pico and Faial.
The 1964 Alaskan earthquake, also known as the Great Alaskan earthquake and Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 5:36 P.M. AST on Good Friday, March 27. Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 139 deaths.Lasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake was the most powerful recorded in North American history, and the second most powerful recorded in world history. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9.1 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.In Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 30 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was reported from all over the world.
The 1964 Baihe earthquake (Chinese: 1964年白河大地震; pinyin: 1964 nián Báihé dà dìzhèn), also known as the Great Baihe earthquake, measured 6.3 local magnitude, and occurred at 20:04 CST (UTC+8) on 18 January in Baihe Township of Tainan County (now part of Tainan City), Taiwan. The hypocenter of the earthquake was 20 kilometers deep. The earthquake killed 106 people, destroyed 10,924 buildings, and caused a great fire in Jiayi City. It was the sixth deadliest earthquake in 20th century Taiwan, and the third deadliest post-World War II, after the 921 earthquake and the 2016 Taiwan earthquake
The 1964 Guerrero earthquake occurred on July 6 at 01:22 local time in Guerrero, Mexico. The magnitude of this earthquake was given as Ms 7.4, or ML 7.2.
The 1964 Niigata earthquake struck at 13:01 local time (04:01 UTC) on 16 June with a magnitude of 7.5 or 7.6. The epicenter was on the continental shelf off the northwest coast of Honshu, Japan in Niigata Prefecture, about 50 kilometres (31 mi) north of the city of Niigata. The earthquake caused liquefaction over large parts of the city.
The 1965 Olympia earthquake occurred at 08:29 PDT (15:29 UTC) on April 29 within the Puget Sound region of Washington State. It had a magnitude of 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It caused the deaths of seven people and about $12.5 million in damage. There were no recorded aftershocks.
The 1965 Ceram Sea earthquake occurred on January 24, 1965 at 00:11 UTC with a moment magnitude of 8.2 and its epicenter was located just off the southwestern coast of Sanana Island in eastern Indonesia. The event occurred at a depth of 28 kilometers under the Ceram Sea, and a tsunami was generated which caused damage in Sanana, Buru, and Mangole. During the tsunami three consecutive run-ups were reported in Seram Island, and a four-meter run-up was reported at Buru Island.A series of tremors were reported during the week leading up to the mainshock. The number of people reported dead was 71 and up to 3,000 buildings and a total of 14 bridges were destroyed by both the earthquake and tsunami on Sanana.
The 1965 Oaxaca earthquake occurred in Mexico on August 23 at 13:46 with a moment magnitude of 7.5. Five people were reported dead in Mexico City and 1 in Oaxaca. There was an anomalous change in seismic activities before the earthquake. There was a quiescent stage from late 1963 to mid-1964, and it was followed by a renewal of seismic activities before the main shock. This earthquake was a shallow thrust earthquake in the interplate subduction zone, in which the Cocos Plate is subducting beneath the North American Plate.
The 1965 Rat Islands earthquake occurred at 05:01 UTC, on 4 February (19:01, 3 February local time). It had a magnitude of 8.7 and triggered a tsunami of over 10 m on Shemya Island, but caused very little damage.
The 1966 Tashkent earthquake (Russian: Ташкентское землетрясение) occurred on 26 April in the Uzbek SSR. It had a magnitude of 5.1 with an epicenter in central Tashkent at a depth of 3–8 kilometers (1.9–5.0 mi). The earthquake caused massive destruction to Tashkent, destroying most of the buildings in the city, killing between 15 and 200 people and leaving 300,000 homeless. Following the disaster, most of the historic parts of Tashkent had been destroyed and the city was rebuilt, modelled on Soviet architectural styles. Soviet authorities created an Institute of seismology in order to forecast future earthquakes.
The 1966 Hualien earthquake occurred on March 13 at 00:31 local time of Taiwan. The epicenter was located in the offshore area between Yonaguni Island, Japan and Hualien, Taiwan.The intensity in Yonaguni reached shindo 5. 2 people were reported dead in Yonaguni, Japan, and 4 in Taiwan. Building damage was reported. A tsunami with a run-up height of 50 cm (20 in) was observed.This earthquake released a seismic moment of 4.86×1020 Nm. The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Ms 8.0, Mw7.79, Mjma 7.8, or ML 7.8. This earthquake had a strike-slip faulting focal mechanism.The fault plane solutions of this earthquake suggested that there is a sliver of crust off the east coast of Taiwan other than the Philippine Sea Plate. The map of shallow earthquakes shows that the Philippines are encircled by a zone of seismicity. There is a difference between the slip direction in the east coast of the Philippines and the relative motion between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Together with other evidences, it has been suggested that most of the Philippines might belong to a minor plate other than the Eurasian Plate.
The 1966 Peru earthquake occurred on October 17 at 16:41 local time (21:41 UTC). It had a magnitude of Mw 8.1. The epicenter was located offcoast near Huacho. About 100 people were reported dead. Most of the damage was recorded in low buildings. Cracks were reported in higher buildings. The intensity was MM IX in San Nicolás, MM VIII in Huacho, and MM VII in Callao. A tsunami was generated by this earthquake, which was recorded in Callao, Chimbote, and San Juan. Landslides and huge ground cracks were reported along the Pan American Highway north of Ancón.
The 1966 Toro earthquake, or the 1966 Ruwenzori earthquake, occurred on March 20, 1966, at 01:42 UTC (04:42 Uganda local time) lasting 3–5 minutes. The earthquake was located near the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), to the south of Lake Albert. Some sources put the epicenter in Uganda while some put it in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 6.8 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale.
The 1966 Varto earthquake occurred on 19 August in Varto town of Muş Province in eastern Turkey. The magnitude of the earthquake was 6.9 on the surface wave magnitude scale and had a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The fatalities reached 2,394 and 1,489 people were wounded. The earthquake devastated all the structures in Varto.This disaster was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 5.6 that hit Varto on 7 March 1966 killing 14 and wounding 75 people.
The Xingtai earthquake (Chinese: 邢台大地震; pinyin: Xíngtái Dà Dìzhèn) was a sequence of major earthquakes that took place between March 8 and March 29, 1966 in the area administered by the prefecture-level city of Xingtai in southern Hebei province, People's Republic of China.The first earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale and epicenter in Longyao County occurred in the early morning of March 8, 1966. It was followed by a sequence of five earthquakes above magnitude 6 on the Richter scale that lasted until March 29, 1966. The strongest of these quakes had a magnitude of 7.2 and took place in the southeastern part of Ningjin County on March 22. The earthquake damage included 8,064 dead, 38,000 injured and more than 5 million destroyed houses.
The 1967 Caracas earthquake occurred on 29 July at 20:00 local time, and was centered near the coast about 30 miles west of Caracas, the capital of Venezuela with a magnitude of 6.5. When the earth stopped shaking, about 240 inhabitants were dead and hundreds injured and buried in the rubble where homes and offices once stood. More than $100 million property damage was incurred in the Caracas area, and about 80,000 persons were left homeless.
The 1967 Koynanagar earthquake occurred near Koynanagar town in Maharashtra, India on 11 December. The 6.5 magnitude shock hit near the site of Koyna dam and claimed at least 180 lives and injured over 1,500. More than 80% of the houses were damaged in Koyana Nagar Township, but it didn't cause any major damage to the dam except some cracks which were quickly repaired. There have been several earthquakes of smaller magnitude there since 1967. The deadly earthquake caused a 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) fissure in the ground which spread over a length of 25 kilometers (16 mi).Some geologists believe that the earthquake was due to reservoir-triggered seismic activity. Senior project officials have repeatedly denied this conclusion.
The 1967 Mudurnu earthquake or more correctly, the 1967 Mudurnu Valley earthquake occurred at about 18:57 local time on 22 July near Mudurnu, Bolu Province, north-western Turkey. The earthquake was one of a series of major and intermediate quakes that have occurred in modern times along the North Anatolian Fault since 1939.
The 1968 Sulawesi earthquake struck Indonesia on August 14. It had a Richter scale magnitude of 7.4, spawned a large tsunami, and killed roughly 200 people.
The 1968 Belice earthquake sequence took place in Sicily between 14 and 15 January. The largest shock measured 5.5 on the moment magnitude scale, with five others of magnitude 5+. The maximum perceived intensity was X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake sequence, centred between the towns of Gibellina, Salaparuta and Poggioreale, killed at least 231 people, possibly more than 400, with between 632 and about 1,000 injured and left 100,000 homeless. It is known in Italy as Terremoto del Belice.
The 1968 Casiguran earthquake occurred on August 1 at 20:19 UTC with a moment magnitude of 7.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The thrust earthquake's epicenter was in Casiguran, Quezon (now part of Aurora province). A small non-destructive tsunami was generated and at least 207 people were killed. The majority of the deaths occurred in the collapse of a six-story building in Manila.
The Dasht-e Bayaz and Ferdows earthquakes occurred in Dashte Bayaz, Kakhk and Ferdows, Iran in late August and early September 1968. The mainshock measured 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli Intensity Scale. Damage was heavy in the affected areas with thousands of lives lost in the first event and many hundreds more in the second strong event.
The 1968 Hyūga-nada earthquake (Japanese: 1968年日向灘地震) occurred on April 1 at 09:42 local time. The earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 7.5, and the epicenter was located in Hyūga-nada Sea, off the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku, Japan. The magnitude of this earthquake was also given as Mjma 7.5. A tsunami was observed. There were 15 people reported injured. The intensity reached shindo 5 in Miyazaki and Kōchi.
The 1968 Illinois earthquake (a "New Madrid event") was the largest recorded earthquake in the U.S. Midwestern state of Illinois. Striking at 11:02 a.m. on November 9, it measured 5.4 on the Richter scale. Although there were no fatalities, the event caused considerable structural damage to buildings, including the toppling of chimneys and shaking in Chicago, the region's largest city. The earthquake was one of the most widely felt in U.S. history, affecting 23 states over an area of 580,000 square miles (1,500,000 km2). In studying its cause, scientists discovered the Cottage Grove Fault in the Southern Illinois Basin.Within the region, millions felt the rupture. Reactions to the earthquake varied: some people near the epicenter did not react to the shaking, while others panicked. A future earthquake in the region is extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6–7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the Wabash Valley seismic zone on the Illinois–Indiana border or the New Madrid fault zone.
The 1968 Inangahua earthquake occurred 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Murchison, New Zealand, near the small town of Inangahua Junction. It struck at 5:24 am NZDT on 24 May 1968 with a depth of only 12 kilometres (7.5 mi), being extremely shallow for an earthquake of its size. The earthquake had a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Very Destructive), and resulted in the deaths of three people, with a further 14 people injured. This makes it New Zealand's fifth deadliest earthquake in recorded history. Numerous aftershocks followed the quake, including 15 that were magnitude 5 or greater and occurred within a month of the initial shock.
The 1968 Tokachi earthquake (1968年十勝沖地震 Sen-kyūhyaku-rokujūhachi-nen Tokachi-oki Jishin) occurred on May 16 at 0:49 UTC (09:49 local time) in the area offshore Aomori and Hokkaido. The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Mw 8.3. The intensity of the earthquake reached shindo 5 in Aomori, Aomori and Hakodate, Hokkaido.
The 1969 Sharm el-Sheikh earthquake occurred on March 31 off the southern Sinai peninsula in northeastern Egypt. The epicenter was located near Shadwan island, southwest of the city of Sharm el-Sheikh, at the confluence of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Suez. The shock measured 6.6 on the surface wave magnitude scale, had a maximum reported intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, and was responsible for several deaths and injuries.
The 1969 Bohai earthquake occurred on July 18, 1969 at 13:24 local time. The epicenter was located in the Bohai Sea, off the coast of Shandong Province, China. The magnitude of this earthquake is MS 7.4. Areas of maximal intensity were mainly distributed around the estuary of the Yellow River. Ground cracks and sand boils were reported. The earthquake could be felt in Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Shandong, and Jiangsu. 10 people were reported dead. This earthquake caused ground surface subsidences of about 15.1 cm ~ 15.8 cm in the Yellow River Delta region. The mechanism of this earthquake was of dextral strike-slip faulting. Although it was located near the Tancheng-Lujiang fault zone (郯庐断裂带), some researchers think that this earthquake was dominated by the seaward extending part of the Huanghekou-Liaocheng seismotectonic zone (黄河口-聊城地震构造带).
The 1969 Portugal earthquake struck western Portugal and Morocco on February 28 at 02:40 UTC. Originating west of the Strait of Gibraltar, the earthquake registered a magnitude of 7.8 and the maximum felt intensity was VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. In total, thirteen people died. Far more people sustained minor injuries.
At 04:56 and 06:19 UTC on October 2, 1969 (21:56 and 23:19 PDT October 1), a pair of earthquakes of magnitude 5.6 and 5.7, respectively, struck the city of Santa Rosa, California, killing one person and damaging buildings. The maximum felt intensity for the two events was VII (Very strong) and VIII (Severe) respectively on the Mercalli intensity scale. The $8.35 million cost of the earthquakes went mostly to replace buildings damaged beyond repair. There were at least 200 aftershocks after the initial pair of earthquakes. At the time they were the largest earthquakes to affect the northern San Francisco Bay Area since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
The 1969 Yangjiang earthquake occurred on 26 July, at 6:49 am, Beijing local time (25 July 22:49 UTC). It had a magnitude of 6.4 on the Moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale It struck the city of Yangjiang and caused over 10,700 houses to collapse, severely damaging a further 36,000. The earthquake also caused landslides and sandblows were observed along the coast and along some rivers in the area of Yangjiang. The earthquake was also felt in Hong Kong. There were an unconfirmed total of 3,000 deaths.
The 1970 Colombia earthquake occurred in Colombia on July 31.
The 1970 Peru–Ecuador earthquake occurred on December 9 at 23:34 local time. The epicenter was located in northwestern Peru, between Piura and Tumbes, near the Peru–Ecuador border. This earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 7.1, or Ms 7.1. About 81 people were reported dead in Peru and in Ecuador together. Liquefaction was observed. The maximum Mercalli Intensity reached IX (Violent). Fractures in constructions were reported in the urban area of Talara. This was a shallow earthquake, and it was thought to occur in the plate above the plate boundary.
The 1970 Ancash earthquake (also known as the Great Peruvian earthquake) occurred on 31 May off the coast of Peru in the Pacific Ocean at 15:23:29 local time. Combined with a resultant landslide, it was the worst catastrophic natural disaster in the history of Peru. Due to the large amounts of snow and ice included in the landslide and its estimated 66,794 to 70,000 casualties, it is also considered to be the world's deadliest avalanche.
The 1970 Gediz earthquake (also known as the 1970 Kütahya-Gediz earthquake) struck western Turkey on 28 March at about 23:05 local time. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.2.The event killed 1,086 people and left 1,260 people wounded and many thousands homeless in Gediz. a district of Kütahya Province situated 98 km (61 mi) southeast of Kütahya. Many people were burned alive as fires broke out from overturned stoves, and 9,452 buildings in the region were severely damaged or destroyed.The town of Gediz, home to repeated natural disasters like earthquakes and floods, was relocated following a government resolution soon after the destruction to a new place 7 km (4.3 mi) away on the road to Uşak under the name "Yeni Gediz" (literally: New Gediz). The residents moved in their newly built, earthquake-resistant homes. Neighboring towns and villages were also rebuilt at places with relative minimum earthquake risk.Other major earthquakes occurred in Gediz in 1866 and 1896, and on June 25, 1944 at 07:20 local time, a magnitude 6.0 earthquake occurred in Gediz, killing 20 people and damaging around 3,500 buildings.
The Great South Eastern Mayo Bay Earthquakes are earthquakes that happened in 1970.
The 1970 New Guinea earthquake struck the eponymous island and shocked the city of Madang on October 31. Causing between five and eighteen fatalities, it rocked the island and sent landslides cascading down steep hills into poorly reinforced wooden huts. The area that experienced the most powerful intensity extended 20 kilometers (12 mi) out from the epicenter. Underwater landslides caused minor tsunami over about 100 km of coast and severed underwater cables in several places.
The 1970 Tonghai earthquake occurred on 4 January with a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The strike-slip rupture originated on the Red River Fault, which had not experienced an earthquake above magnitude 7 since 1700, and affected Tonghai County, Yunnan province, China. At least 10,000 people were killed, making it one of the deadliest in its decade. The tremor caused between US$5 to $25 million in damage, felt over an area of 8,781 km2 (3,390 sq mi). In Hanoi, North Vietnam, almost 483 km (300 mi) from the epicenter, victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city.Occurring during the height of the Cultural Revolution, it was not widely publicized by the Chinese government for well over a decade. The amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post as "pathetically small". Much of the aid provided to survivors was in "spiritual" form, including Mao Zedong badges and condolence letters. Nevertheless, the earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. It was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the largest earthquake monitoring system in China, 25 years later.
The 1971 Solomon Islands earthquakes occurred in the northern part of the Solomon Islands, within Papua New Guinea as a doublet earthquake. The first large shock occurred on July 14 at 06:11 UTC with a magnitude of Mw 8.0. The second large event occurred on July 26 at 01:23 UTC with a magnitude of Mw 8.1. The initial event on July 14 caused a tsunami, which was observed in Rabaul. The earthquake of July 26 triggered a tsunami with a 3.4 m (11 ft) runup in New Britain.Shallow, large thrust earthquakes in the Solomon Islands tend to occur in multiplets. Examples of such earthquakes include the doublets occurred in 1971, 1974, and 1975. The 1971 doublet occurred at the junction of two trenches. The July 14 earthquake is located in the northwestern Solomon Islands Trench, while the July 26 earthquake ruptured the northeastern New Britain Trench. The July 14 earthquake and the July 26 earthquake were caused by the subduction of the Solomon Sea Plate beneath the Pacific Plate and the Bismark Sea Plate, respectively. The 1971 sequence had the largest earthquake in 50 years in this region as it occurred.
The 1971 Bingöl earthquake occurred at 18:43 local time (16:43 UTC) on 22 May. It had a magnitude of 6.7 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, killing about 1,000 people.
The 1971 San Fernando earthquake (also known as the Sylmar earthquake) occurred in the early morning of February 9 in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California. The unanticipated thrust earthquake had a moment magnitude of 6.5 or 6.7 (as determined by several independent institutions) and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The event was one in a series that affected the Los Angeles area in the late 20th century, and a study of the Sierra Madre Fault during that time indicated that more substantial thrust earthquakes had occurred near the Transverse Ranges in the past. Damage was locally severe in the northern San Fernando Valley, and surface faulting was extensive to the south of the epicenter in the mountains, as well as urban settings along city streets and neighborhoods. Uplift and other effects affected private homes and businesses.The event affected a number of health care facilities in Sylmar, San Fernando, and other densely populated areas north of central Los Angeles. The Olive View Medical Center and Veterans Hospital both experienced very heavy damage, and buildings collapsed at both sites, causing the majority of deaths that occurred. The buildings at both facilities were constructed with mixed styles, but engineers were unable to thoroughly study the buildings' responses because they were not outfitted with instruments for recording strong ground motion, and this prompted the Veterans Administration to install seismometers at its high-risk sites. Other sites throughout the Los Angeles area had been instrumented as a result of local ordinances, and an extraordinary amount of strong motion data was recorded, more so than any other event up until that time. The success in this area spurred the initiation of California's Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.Transportation around the Los Angeles area was severely afflicted with roadway failures and the partial collapse of several major freeway interchanges. The near total failure of the Lower Van Norman Dam resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands of downstream residents, though an earlier decision to maintain the water at a lower level may have contributed to saving the dam from being overtopped. Schools were affected, as they had been during a previous earthquake in Long Beach, but this time amended construction styles improved the outcome for the thousands of school buildings in the Los Angeles area. Other aspects of the event included a methane seep that emanated from the floor of the Pacific Ocean near Malibu for several days, and hundreds of various types of landslides that were documented in the San Gabriel mountains. As had happened following other earthquakes in California, legislation related to building codes was once again revised, with laws that specifically addressed the construction of homes or businesses near known active fault zones.
The 1972 Qir earthquake occurred at 05:37 local time (02:06 UTC) on April 10, 1972. It had a magnitude of 6.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicentre was in the province of Fars in southern Iran. The earthquake caused the destruction of Qir and serious damage to towns and villages in the surrounding area. The estimated number of deaths is 5,374, with a further 1,710 injured.
The 1972 Nicaragua earthquake occurred at 12:29 a.m. local time (06:29 UTC) on Saturday, December 23 near Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. It had a magnitude of 6.2, with the epicenter 28 kilometers northeast of the city centre, and a depth of about 5 kilometers. Within an hour after the main shock, two aftershocks, one of magnitude 5.0 and the other 5.2, occurred at 1:18 a.m. and 1:20 a.m. The earthquake caused widespread casualties among Managua's residents: 6,000 were killed, 20,000 were injured and over 250,000 were left homeless.
The 1972 Ruisui earthquake (also known as the 1972 Juisui earthquake) occurred on April 24 at 17:57 local time. The magnitude of this earthquake was given as Ms 7.2 by the United States Geological Survey and ML 6.9 by the Central Weather Bureau of Taiwan. The epicenter was located near Ruisui Township, Hualien County, Taiwan. The intensity was shindo 4 in Taipei and Hualien. Five people were reported dead. The Ruisui Bridge (Chinese: 瑞穗大橋) was destroyed. The water treatment plant in Ruisui was damaged.This earthquake was caused by the Juisui Fault with a vertical movement of 70 centimeters (28 in). The Juisui Fault is a segment of the 150 kilometers (93 mi) long Longitudinal Valley Fault, which is a left-lateral fault with a reverse component. The boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the Philippine Plate lies along the Longitudinal Valley Fault.
The 1973 Salta earthquake took place in the Province of Salta, in the Republic of Argentina, on 19 November at 11:19 a.m.. It registered a magnitude of 5.9 on the Richter magnitude scale and occurred at a depth of 12 kilometres (7.5 mi).
The Veracruz earthquake of 1973, also known as El Terremoto de Orizaba, occurred at 3:50 a.m. local time (9:50 GMT) on August 28, with the epicenter located in the vicinity of Serdan in the State of Puebla. It registered 7.0 on the Richter magnitude scale and had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The effects of the earthquake were felt in the Mexican states of Veracruz and Puebla in southeast Mexico.
The 1974 Zhaotong earthquake occurred at 19:25 UTC on 10 May. It had a magnitude that was measured at 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale and 7.1 on the surface wave magnitude scale. It had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicenter was located in Zhaotong prefecture in Yunnan province and it caused between 1,641 and 20,000 deaths.
The 1974 Hunza earthquake occurred in the rugged and isolated Hunza, Hazara and Swat districts of northern Pakistan at 12:11 UTC [17:11 PST] on 28 December. The epicentre was located at 35.0 degrees north and 72.8 degrees east. The 6.2 magnitude quake had a shallow focal depth and was followed by numerous aftershocks. An official estimate of the number killed was 5,300 with approximately 17,000 injured. A total of 97,000 were reported affected by the tremor. Most of the destruction was centered on the village of Pattan, located about 100 miles (160 km) north of the capital city of Islamabad. The village was almost completely destroyed.The epicental region is characterized by steep-walled narrow canyons and valleys. Most of the population was concentrated along the rivers. Much of the destruction was caused by the numerous landslides and rockfalls which came tumbling down from high above. The main road leading into the area was blocked for about 25 miles (40 km) by landslides and rockfalls, hampering relief efforts. The government flew in emergency supplies by helicopter until the roads were reopened on 13 January.The earthquake, which reached MMI V in Kabul, Afghanistan, affected some 1,000 square miles (2,600 km2) of the Indus Valley region. Several nations contributed money and supplies to aid the inhabitants of the stricken area.
The 1974 Izu Peninsula earthquake (Japanese: 1974年伊豆半島沖地震 Sen-kyūhyaku-nanajūyo-nen Izu-hantō-oki Jishin) occurred on May 9 at 08:33 local time. The epicenter was located off the Izu Peninsula, Japan. 25 people were reported dead. Landslides and damage of roads, buildings, and infrastructure were reported. This earthquake triggered a small tsunami. The intensity in Tokyo reached shindo 3. The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Ms 6.5, or Mjma 6.9.
The 1974 Lima earthquake occurred on October 3 at 14:21 UTC (09:21 local time). It was located at about 80 km southwest of Lima, Peru. The magnitude of the earthquake was put at 8.1 Mw, or Ms 7.8. The earthquake caused 78 deaths and about 2400 injured. The intensity around Lima was generally about MM V to VII, but the maximum reached IX. Two buildings of reinforced concrete collapsed in La Molina, where the intensity was MM VIII to IX. A four-story reinforced concrete building in Callao collapsed.The largest aftershock occurred on November 9, 1974 at 12:59 UTC (07:59 local time) with a magnitude of Mw 7.1, or Ms 7.1. The November 9 aftershock was located at about 25 km south of the main shock.
The 1975 Hawaii earthquake was a large earthquake and tsunami event in Hawaii. The quake measured 7.2 on the Moment magnitude scale, and was felt across several of the Hawaiian Islands. This event was notable for the large tsunami that was as high as 47 feet triggered by the quake. Two people were killed and 19 others were injured. Significant damage occurred in the southern part of the Big Island worth $4.1 million from the shaking and the tsunami. The tsunami was also detected in Alaska, California, Japan, Samoa, and on Johnston and Wake Islands. The earthquake also caused significant changes to shorelines along the southern coast of the Big Island with subsidence of 12 feet observed causing some areas to be permanently submerged. It also triggered a small brief eruption of Kilauea volcano. The quake itself occurred on the Hilina Slump, which was responsible for a more powerful earthquake and tsunami in 1868.
The 1975 Haicheng earthquake, hit Haicheng, Liaoning in China at 19:36 CST on February 4. The earthquake registered at 7.3 on the Richter Scale, which is associated with total destruction of infrastructure and property. Haicheng had approximately 1 million residents at the time of the earthquake, which is known for being one of the few earthquakes to be successfully predicted throughout history.Early in the morning of February 4, 1975, Chinese officials ordered that the city of Haicheng be evacuated, believing there to be a large chance of an earthquake occurring. The prediction was allegedly based on reports of changes in groundwater and soil elevations over the past several months as well as widespread accounts of unusual animal behavior. A low-level alert was triggered by regional increases in seismicity (later recognized as foreshocks). Both authorities and citizens were finally placed on high alert and an evacuation order was issued due to an increase in foreshocks. Though this particular prediction of the earthquake was initially believed to be just the latest in a recent string of false alarms that had occurred in the preceding months, including one case of an earthquake swarm being caused by the filling of a reservoir, the evacuation of Haicheng proceeded anyway and eventually paid off.The evacuation, despite successfully evacuating most of Haicheng's population, did not prevent deaths in its entirety. When the main quake struck at 7:36 pm, 2,041 people died, over 27,000 were injured and thousands of buildings collapsed. However, the death toll was much lower than the estimate of over 150,000 dead which is believed to have resulted if the evacuation had not taken place. This was the only successful evacuation of a potentially affected population before a devastating earthquake in history.In addition to damage in Liaoning Province and its surroundings, minor damage was also reported in Seoul, South Korea. The quake was felt in Primorskiy Krai, USSR, and in Kyushu, Japan.In recent years, the success of the earthquake's prediction has come under scrutiny. Seismologists have agreed that the Haicheng earthquake can't be looked to as any sort of "prototype" for predicting future earthquakes, as the foreshocks that played a huge role in leading to prediction of this earthquake are not a regular, reliable occurrence before all earthquakes. However, Qi-Fu Chen, a research professor at Beijing's China Earthquake Administration, explained that this earthquake at least "showed the importance of public education," prompting a further discussion about the necessity of making the public aware of the dangers, preparations, and warning signs related to earthquakes.
The 1975 Kinnaur earthquake occurred in the early afternoon (local time) (08:02 UTC) of 19 January. It had a magnitude of 6.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale, causing extensive damage in Himachal Pradesh, in northern India. Its epicentre was in Kinnaur district in the southeastern part of Himachal Pradesh and caused 47 casualties. Landslides, rock falls and avalanches caused major damage to the Hindustan-Tibet Road. The earthquake affected many monasteries and buildings in the state and led to an extensive restoration work in the late 1970s and early 1980s in Himachal Pradesh. The Spiti and Parachu valleys in particular suffered the greatest damage being on the north-south Kaurik-Chango fault, causing damage to landmarks such as Key Monastery and Tabo Monastery.
The 1975 Lice earthquake was a magnitude 6.7 earthquake that struck the Turkish district of Lice at 12:20 local time (09:20 UTC) on 6 September 1975, killing 2,311 people. The epicenter was located near the town of Lice. The maximum felt intensity was VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale.

The shock occurred 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) south of the Bali Sea coast of the Buleleng Regency, and about 65 kilometres (40 mi) northwest of Denpasar. The temblor seriously damaged or destroyed up to ninety percent of houses in Buleleng Regency and caused the almost complete destruction of Seririt sub-district, where a school building collapsed and trapped at least 200 students. 573 people are believed to have died as a result of the temblor; at least 544 in Buleleng Regency, 24 in Jembrana and 5 in Tabanan. Four thousand more suffered injuries and an estimated 450,000 were left temporarily homeless.
The 1976 Çaldıran–Muradiye earthquake occurred at 14:22 local time (12:22 UTC) on 24 November. The epicenter was located near Çaldıran, 20 km northeast of Muradiye, in the Van Province of eastern Turkey. The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.3 with a maximum intensity of X on the Mercalli intensity scale. The area of severe damage, where over 80% of the buildings were destroyed, covered an area of 2,000 square kilometres. There were between 4,000 and 5,000 casualties.
The 1976 Friuli earthquake, also known in Italy as Terremoto del Friuli (Friulian earthquake), took place on May 6 with a moment magnitude of 6.5 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). The shock occurred in the Friuli region in northeast Italy near the town of Gemona del Friuli. Up to 978 people were killed, 2,400 were injured, and 157,000 were left homeless.
The 1976 Guatemala earthquake struck on February 4 at 03:01:43 local time with a moment magnitude of 7.5. The shock was centered on the Motagua Fault, about 160 km northeast of Guatemala City at a depth of 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) near the town of Los Amates in the department of Izabal.Cities throughout the country suffered damage, and most adobe type houses in the outlying areas of Guatemala City were destroyed. The earthquake struck during the early morning (at 3:01 am, local time) when most people were asleep. This contributed to the high death toll of 23,000. Approximately 76,000 were injured, and many thousands left homeless. Some of areas went without electricity and communications for days.The main shock was followed by thousands of aftershocks, some of the larger ones causing additional damage and loss of life.
The 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake and tsunami took place on August 17, 1976, at 00:11 local time, near the islands of Mindanao and Sulu, in the Philippines. Its magnitude was calculated as being as high as 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale.
The 1976 Papua earthquake occurred on 25 June with a moment magnitude of 7.1 in Papua, Indonesia. Total deaths for the event amounted to 422, including 70 who died in subsequent landslides.
The 1976 Songpan–Pingwu earthquake struck Songpan and Pingwu in Sichuan, China. The earthquake was preceded by an earthquake swarm lasting 3 years prior to the 1976 earthquake. The mainshock occurred on August 16 at 14:06:47 UTC and had a moment magnitude of 6.7. Several large aftershocks (6.3 and 6.4 Mw) occurred within several days. During the period from August 16 to August 30, following the mainshock, there were over 400 aftershocks that were recorded with a magnitude greater than or equal to 3.0. The earthquake hit with an estimated population exposure between IX and VIII. Overall, it resulted in 41 deaths.
The Tangshan earthquake, also known as the Great Tangshan earthquake, was a natural disaster that occurred on July 27, 1976. It is believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll. The epicenter of the earthquake was near Tangshan in Hebei, People's Republic of China, an industrial city with approximately one million inhabitants. The number of deaths initially reported by the Chinese government was 655,000, but this number has since been stated to be around 240,000 to 255,000. Another report indicates that the actual death toll was much higher, at approximately 650,000, and explains that the lower estimates are limited to Tangshan and exclude fatalities in the densely populated surrounding areas.A further 164,000 people were recorded as being severely injured. The earthquake occurred between a series of political events involving the Communist Party of China, ultimately leading to the expulsion of the ruling Gang of Four by Mao Zedong's chosen successor, Hua Guofeng. In traditional Chinese thought, natural disasters are seen as a precursor of dynastic change.The earthquake hit in the early morning and lasted 14 to 16 seconds. Chinese government official sources state a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter magnitude scale, though some sources listed it as high as 8.2. It was followed by a major 7.1 magnitude aftershock some 16 hours later, increasing the death toll to over 255,000. The earthquake was generated by the 25-mile-long Tangshan Fault, which runs near the city and ruptured due to tectonic forces caused by the Amurian Plate sliding past the Eurasian Plate.
The 1977 Sumba earthquake (also called the Sumbawa earthquake) occurred approximately 290 kilometres (180 mi) south of Bima, Sumbawa, and beneath the Indian Ocean, at 14:08 local time on 19 August. With a moment magnitude of 8.3, the earthquake is notable for having an unusually great magnitude for a shock with a normal faulting focal mechanism. The shock occurred near the southern section of the Sunda Trench where several other tsunami-generating earthquakes have occurred. The earthquake was at the time the largest outer-rise earthquake ever recorded in Indonesia, and aftershocks along the trench extended about 130 kilometres (81 mi) eastward and 110 kilometres (68 mi) westward from the epicenter.Although damage from the earthquake was limited to Indonesia, ground movement was reportedly felt as far afield as Albany in Australia, and the power supply was briefly cut in Port Hedland. A tsunami was generated with observed run-up heights of up to 5.8 meters (19 ft) and inundation distances of up to 1,200 metres (3,900 ft) at several locations on Sumba and Sumbawa. The combined number of victims from both the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia was at least 107 confirmed dead and several dozen others missing, presumed dead; several sources combine the two for a total casualty figure of approximately 180 deaths and 1,100 injuries.
The 1977 Vrancea earthquake occurred on Friday, 4 March 1977, at 21:22 local time, and was felt throughout the Balkans. It had a magnitude of 7.2, making it the second most powerful earthquake recorded in Romania in the 20th century, after 10 November 1940 seismic event. The epicenter was situated in the Vrancea Mountains, the most seismically active part of Romania, at a depth of 94 km.The earthquake killed about 1,578 people (1,424 in Bucharest) in Romania, and wounded more than 11,300. Among the victims were actor Toma Caragiu and writers A. E. Bakonsky, Alexandru Ivasiuc and Corneliu M. Popescu. Communist ruler Nicolae Ceaușescu suspended his official visit to Nigeria and declared state of emergency.About 32,900 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Immediately after the earthquake, 35,000 families were without shelter. The economic losses are believed to have been as high as two billion US dollars though the sum was not confirmed by the authorities at that time. A detailed report on the destruction the earthquake caused was never published. Most of the damage was concentrated in Romania's capital, Bucharest, where about 33 large buildings collapsed. Most of those buildings were built before the World War II, and were not reinforced. After the earthquake, the Romanian government imposed tougher construction standards.In Bulgaria, the earthquake is known as the Vrancea earthquake or Svishtov earthquake. Three blocks of flats in the Bulgarian town of Svishtov (near Zimnicea) collapsed, killing more than 100 people. Many other buildings were damaged, including the Church of the Holy Trinity. In the Soviet Republic of Moldova the earthquake destroyed and damaged many buildings. In the capital Chişinău, a panic broke out.
The 1977 San Juan earthquake, also known as Caucete earthquake, took place in the province of San Juan, Argentina, on 23 November at 09:26:23 AM. It measured 7.4 on the surface wave magnitude scale, and had a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale.The earthquake caused fatalities and severe damage to buildings throughout the province, especially in the city of Caucete, where at least 65 people died. It also caused slight damage in the north of the Greater Mendoza metropolitan area.

The 1978 Tabas earthquake occurred on September 16 at 19:05:55 local time in central Iran. The shock measured 7.4 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). The death toll was in the range of 15,000–25,000 with severe effects in the town of Tabas.Eighty percent of the loss of life occurred in Tabas, but a total of 85 villages were affected. This shock was felt in Tehran, about 610 kilometers (380 mi) away. About 55–85 km (34–53 mi) of ground deformation was observed, with about 1.7 meters (5 ft 7 in) of maximum slip. Only one significant M5 aftershock occurred.
The 1979 Bali earthquake occurred at 03:58 local time on 18 December with a surface wave magnitude of 6.3. The shock occurred southeast of the coast of Karangasem Regency in the Lombok Strait, and about 60 kilometres (37 mi) east-northeast of Denpasar. The temblor damaged up to 80 percent of the buildings in Karangasem Regency, displaced between 15,000 and 500,000 people and briefly severed road links to the provincial capital, Denpasar.
The 1979 Coyote Lake earthquake occurred at 10:05:24 local time on August 6 with a moment magnitude of 5.7 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock occurred on the Calaveras Fault near Coyote Lake in Santa Clara County, California and resulted in a number of injuries, including some that required hospitalization. Most of the $500,000 in damage that was caused was non-structural, but several businesses were closed for repairs. Data from numerous strong motion instruments was used to determine the type, depth, and extent of slip. A mild aftershock sequence lasted throughout the remainder of the month that was of interest to seismologists, especially with regard to fault creep, and following the event, local governments evaluated their response to the incident.
The 1979 Tumaco earthquake occurred at 02:59 local time on 12 December with a moment magnitude of 8.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The epicenter was just offshore from the border between Ecuador and Colombia, near the port city of Tumaco. It triggered a major tsunami, which was responsible for most of the estimated 300–600 deaths. The hardest hit area was Colombia's Nariño Department.
The 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake occurred at 16:16 Pacific Daylight Time (23:16 UTC) on October 15 just south of the Mexico–United States border. It affected Imperial Valley in Southern California and Mexicali Valley in northern Baja California. The earthquake had a relatively shallow hypocenter and caused property damage in the United States estimated at $30 million USD. The irrigation systems in the Imperial Valley were badly affected, but no deaths occurred. It was the largest earthquake to occur in the contiguous United States since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake eight years earlier.The earthquake was 6.4 on the moment magnitude scale, with a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. However, most of the intensity measurements were consistent with an overall maximum intensity of VII (Very strong), and only the damage to a single structure, the Imperial County Services building in El Centro, was judged to be of intensity IX. Several comprehensive studies on the total structural failure of this building were conducted with a focus on how the building responded to the earthquake's vibration. It was one of the first heavily instrumented office buildings to be severely damaged by seismic forces.The Imperial Valley is surrounded by a number of interconnected fault systems and is vulnerable to both moderate and strong earthquakes as well as earthquake swarms. The area was equipped with an array of strong motion seismographs for analyzing the fault mechanisms of nearby earthquakes and seismic characteristics of the sediments in the valley. The earthquake was significant in the scientific community for studies of both fault mechanics and repeat events. Four of the region's known strike-slip faults and one additional newly discovered normal fault all broke the surface during the earthquake.
The 1979 Montenegro earthquake occurred on April 15 at 06:19 UTC with a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (Extreme). It was the most devastating earthquake on the territory of present-day Montenegro, then part of SFR Yugoslavia, and was mostly felt along the Montenegrin and Albanian coastline.
The 1980 Eureka earthquake (also known as the Gorda Basin earthquake) occurred on November 8 at 02:27:34 local time along the northern coastal area of California in the United States. With a moment magnitude of 7.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong), this strike-slip earthquake was the largest to occur in California in 28 years. Although damage was considered light, several loss estimates equaled or exceeded $2 million, and six injuries resulted when two vehicles came down with the partial collapse of a highway overpass on US 101 in Fields Landing. The north coast of California experiences frequent plate boundary earthquakes near the Mendocino Triple Junction and intraplate events also occur within the Gorda Plate.Due to the regional seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, but the majority of records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.
The 1980 Honduras earthquake struck just offshore Honduras on August 9 at 05:45 UTC. Two people were killed and many injured.
Striking the Autonomous Region of Azores on 1 January, the 1980 Azores Island earthquake killed 61 people and injured over 400, causing severe damage on the islands of Terceira and São Jorge. Measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale, it also shook the islands of Pico and Faial, and resulted from a strike slip fracture, typical of other historical Azorean earthquakes.In response to the earthquake, Portuguese president António Ramalho Eanes announced three days of national mourning, while relief efforts, initiated by agents of the local Air Force, were soon accompanied by government-supported agencies.
The 1980 Oaxaca earthquake occurred on October 24, 1980. It killed 300 and measured 7.0 on the surface wave measurement scale.

It is known in Italy as Terremoto dell'Irpinia (Irpinian earthquake).
The 1981 Dawu earthquake occurred on 24 January at 5:13 a.m. CST, in Sichuan, China. Registering a surface wave magnitude of 6.8, the earthquake killed about 150 people and injured roughly 300 more. It caused comprehensive damage within close range of its epicenter.
On January 19, 1981, eastern Indonesia was struck by an earthquake known as the 1981 Irian Jaya earthquake. Registering a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale, it killed more than 300 people, damaging structures and buildings across the Irian Jaya province.Indonesia is highly active in terms of seismicity and volcanic eruptions, with a subduction zone and many faults. It is neighbored by several tectonic plates. Such earthquakes pose a significant threat to life in the area through earthquakes and also tsunamis.
The 1981 Playa Azul earthquake occurred on October 25, 1981 at 03:22 UTC (on October 24, 1981 at 21:22 local time). It was located near Playa Azul, Michoacán, Mexico. The magnitude of the earthquake was Mw 7.2, or Ms 7.3. Three deaths were reported, two from Michoacán and one from Mexico City. Some buildings were damaged in both Michoacán and Mexico City. A small tsunami was registered in Acapulco with a maximum height of 9 cm.
The 1981 Sirch earthquake occurred at 00:22 local time (17:22 UTC) on July 28. It had a magnitude of 7.2 on the moment magnitude scale or 7.1 Surface wave magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The epicentre was in the province of Kerman in eastern Iran. The earthquake caused the destruction of Kerman and serious damage to towns and villages in the surrounding area. The estimated number of deaths is 1,500, with a further 1,000 injured, 50,000 homeless, and extensive damage in the Kerman Region.This is the largest event in the Kerman province since the 1981 Golbaf earthquake that killed 3,000 people. The 2003 Bam earthquake was the most significant earthquake in the Kerman Province.
The 1982 El Salvador earthquake occurred on 19 June 1982 at 00:21 local time (06:21 UTC). It was an Ms 7.2 earthquake, with epicenter being located in the Pacific Ocean about 60 km southeast of San Salvador, El Salvador. 8 people were reported dead, and 1630 houses were damaged. The earthquake triggered many landslides. The intensity in San Salvador reached MM VII. The most affected cities are San Salvador, Ahuachapán, Concepción de Ataco, Comasagua, San Miguel, San Pedro Nonualco, and San Juan Tepezontes. This earthquake could be felt in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, with intensities MM V in Guatemala City, Guatemala, MM IV in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, MM V in Managua, Nicaragua, and MM III in San Jose, Costa Rica. Near the Salvadorian coast, the Cocos Plate is subducting beneath the Caribbean Plate at the Middle America Trench. This earthquake was an intra-slab, normal-slip subduction earthquake in the subducting plate. The subduction zone and a local system of faults along the volcanic chain are two major sources of the earthquakes in El Salvador. The mechanism of this earthquake had many similarities with the El Salvador earthquake of 13 January 2001.
The 1982 Flores earthquake struck the island of Flores in Indonesia on December 25. Registering a moment magnitude of 5.9, according to the International Seismological Centre, it created landslides and was reportedly accompanied by a tsunami. The earthquake killed thirteen people and left 390 injured, also destroying 1,875 houses and 121 other buildings. The villages of Layahong and Oyong Barang were damaged by seven seconds of shaking.The Lesser Sunda Islands lie in a region with frequent seismicity, and there is a history of tsunamis in the area. Both the subduction of the Australian Plate and the crust in the Flores Sea could be responsible for this activity.The five most affected districts were evacuated of 6,000 people. The local and regional governments were petitioned for supplies like tents, medicine, and food. The earthquake was followed by several aftershocks.In 1992, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck the island. It was the deadliest earthquake of the year, killing roughly 2,500 people.
The 1982 North Yemen earthquake hit near the city of Dhamar, North Yemen (now part of Yemen) on December 13. Measuring 6.0 on the surface wave magnitude scale, with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale, as many as 2,800 people were killed and another 1,500 injured.

It had a magnitude of 8.0 Mw.The earthquake was felt between the Antofagasta Region in the north, and the Araucanía Region in the south, being felt with more power in Central Chile. It reached a maximum intensity of IX in the Mercalli intensity scale. The most affected zone was the port of San Antonio, in Valparaíso Region, together with Alhué and Melipilla in Santiago Metropolitan Region and Rengo in O'Higgins Region. The earthquake also affected Chile's capital city Santiago with great intensity.
The 1985 Luquan earthquake occurred on April 18, 1985 at 13:52 local time (05:52 UTC). The epicenter was near Luquan (禄劝) County, Yunnan, China. Research showed that the source of this earthquake was Zeyi Fault (则邑断层). 22 people were killed and more than 300 injured in this earthquake.
The 1985 Mendoza earthquake was a medium-intensity seismic movement in the province of Mendoza, Argentina. It took place 7 minutes after midnight on 26 January 1985, and had a magnitude of 6.2 in the Richter scale. Its epicenter was located about 45 km southwest of Mendoza, the provincial capital, at the southern end of the region's pre-Andes range, and at a depth of 15 km. It was felt as grade VIII in the Mercalli intensity scale.The earthquake caused 6 deaths and about 100 injuries. In the affected Greater Mendoza area, where most of the provincial population is concentrated, one third of the buildings were built of adobe. Some 23,000 homes were destroyed or condemned, though the actual number might have been larger. Estimates vary between 50,000 and 100,000 people left homeless.A report released soon afterwards stated that the main reason why the event did not produce thousands of casualties was its short duration (less than 10 seconds). In addition, the fact that it was a summer Friday night might have led many people to be sitting outside their homes, chatting with their neighbors, rather than sleeping inside.
The 1985 Mexico City earthquake struck in the early morning of 19 September at 7:17:50 am (CST) with a moment magnitude of 8.0 and a Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The event caused serious damage to the Greater Mexico City area and the deaths of at least 5,000 people. The sequence of events included a foreshock of magnitude 5.2 that occurred the prior May, the mainshock on 19 September, and two large aftershocks. The first of these occurred on 20 September with a magnitude of 7.5 and the second occurred seven months later on 30 April 1986 with a magnitude of 7.0. They were located off the coast along the Middle America Trench, more than 350 kilometres (220 mi) away, but the city suffered major damage due to its large magnitude and the ancient lake bed that Mexico City sits on. The event caused between three and four billion USD in damage as 412 buildings collapsed and another 3,124 were seriously damaged in the city.
The 1985 Nahanni earthquakes is the name for a continuous sequence of earthquakes that began in 1985 in the Nahanni region of the Northwest Territories, Canada. The largest of these earthquakes occurred on December 23, reaching 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale. This is one of the most significant earthquakes in Canada during the 20th century.The earthquakes had a long succession of aftershocks and jolts. The earthquakes amazed both the general public and the earth science community and have been felt in the Yukon, Alberta, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and southeastern Alaska.
The 1985 Rapel Lake earthquake occurred on 8 April at 21:56:59 local time with a moment magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock was centered 75 kilometres (47 mi) southwest of Santiago, Chile, with a focal depth of 37.8 km (23 mi).
The 1985 Wuqia earthquake occurred on August 23, 1985 at 20:41 local time (12:41 UTC) near the border of Wuqia (乌恰) (also Ulugqat or Uluqat) County and Shufu (疏附) County, Xinjiang, China. It had a magnitude of Ms 7.4 and caused 71 deaths, 162 injuries, and left 15,000 homeless, as well as destroying 85% of buildings and highways. The source of this earthquake is the Kazkeaerte Fault (卡兹克阿尔特断裂). The earthquake could be felt throughout much of the Fergana Basin, USSR, as well as in Pakistan.The slipping of the earth during this earthquake caused a deformation zone along the Kezilesu River valley stretching 15 kilometers long and 800 meters wide. The zone is made up of smaller faults, fissures, and pressure ridges.
The 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake occurred on July 8 at 02:20:44 local time with a moment magnitude of 6.0 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of VII (Very strong). The shock occurred in a complex setting along the San Andreas Fault Zone where it bisects San Gorgonio Mountain and San Jacinto Peak at the San Gorgonio Pass and was the first in a series of three earthquakes that affected southern California and the northern Owens Valley in July 1986. Between 29 and 40 people were injured, and financial losses were estimated to be in the range of $4.5 to 6 million.
Striking central Romania on August 30 at 21:28 UTC, the 1986 Vrancea earthquake killed more than 150 people, injured over 500, and damaged over 50,000 homes. The second largest earthquake in the area since the modernization of earthquake monitoring devices, it was felt north to Poland and south to Italy and Greece. The death toll makes it the second deadliest earthquake to occur in 1986 worldwide, after major seism of San Salvador that took the lives of almost 1,500 people.One local news facility listed that the earthquake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale, and the USGS listed its seismic moments as 5.6 and 7.9. A research paper of V. I. Ulomov cited this earthquake with magnitude Mw 7.1. Its epicenter was somewhere in the Vrancea Mountains.The focal mechanism of the earthquake was described as "moderately well controlled", suggesting reverse faulting with some strike-slip motion.
The 1986 Chalfant Valley earthquake struck southern Mono County near Bishop and Chalfant, California at 07:42:28 Pacific Daylight Time on July 21. With a moment magnitude of 6.2 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VI (Strong), the shock injured two people and caused property damage estimated at $2.7 million in the affected areas. There was a significant foreshock and aftershock sequence that included a few moderate events, and was the last in a series of three earthquakes that affected southern California and the northern Owens Valley in July 1986.Strong motion stations at the Long Valley Dam and an instrumented building in Bishop captured light to moderate readings from the event. The faulting reached the surface of the ground, but the maximum amount of measurable slip was limited to about 11 centimeters (4.3 in) of strike-slip motion along the White Mountain Fault Zone. Other destructive and surface-rupturing earthquakes, as well as large volume volcanic eruptions, have occurred in the area. Although the series of shocks occurred within the White Mountain seismic gap, the region continues to have potential for a very large earthquake.
The 1986 San Salvador earthquake occurred at 11:49:26 local time on October 10 with a moment magnitude of 5.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The shock caused considerable damage to El Salvador's capital city of San Salvador and surrounding areas, including neighboring Honduras and Guatemala.
The 1987 Ecuador earthquakes occurred over a six-hour period on March 6. The sequence of shocks measured 6.7, 7.1, and 6.0 on the moment magnitude scale. The mainshock had a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The earthquakes were centered in Napo Province in northeast Ecuador; the epicenters were on the eastern slopes of the Andes, about 75 km ENE of Quito and 25 km north of Reventador Volcano. The earthquakes caused about 1,000 deaths. Four-thousand were missing and an estimated US$1 billion in damage was caused.
The 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake measured 6.5 on the moment magnitude scale and struck the Bay of Plenty region of New Zealand on 2 March. The shock was centred on the town of Edgecumbe and occurred just after 1:42 pm. at a shallow depth of approximately 8 km. It was one of the most damaging New Zealand's North Island has experienced in recent decades, with approximately 50% of the houses damaged. There was extensive damage to a local milk factory, with large storage tanks toppled. Kawerau was another nearby town that suffered damage and Whakatane was also badly shaken. An 80-tonne New Zealand Railways DC class locomotive was thrown onto its side.There were no fatalities; one person died at the time as a result of a heart attack. A foreshock just minutes before had cut the power supply and many people had moved away from heavy machinery and out of their houses. The largest aftershock was measured at 5.2 and struck at 1.52 pm.A crack 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) long opened in the Rangitaiki Plains near Edgecumbe. It is now known as the 'Edgecumbe Fault'. At one point, the land close to the fault dropped 2 metres (6.6 ft). Railway tracks were twisted and bent, and a diesel-electric locomotive toppled over.The epicentre was approximately 2.24 kilometres (1.39 mi) south-south-east of the town of Matata, or 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north-north-west of Edgecumbe. The intense ground shaking led to a large number of ground surface failures, including sand boils, ridge-top shatters and debris avalanches on steeper slopes.
The 1987 Santiago de Chuco earthquake struck Peru on October 2 with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IV (Light). The shock killed three people and caused damage to homes in the titular province.
The 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake occurred in the southern San Gabriel Valley and surrounding communities of southern California at 7:42 a.m. PDT on October 1. The moderate 5.9 magnitude blind thrust earthquake was centered several miles north of Whittier in the town of Rosemead, had a relatively shallow depth, and was felt throughout southern California and southern Nevada. A large number of homes and businesses were impacted, along with roadway disruptions, mainly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Damage estimates ranged from $213–358 million, with 200 injuries, three directly-related deaths, and five additional fatalities that were associated with the event.Mercalli intensity values for the greater Los Angeles area varied with ranges from VI (Strong) to VII (Very strong). Only Whittier experienced a level of VIII (Severe), the highest experienced during the event, with the historic uptown area suffering the greatest damage. A separate M5.2 strike-slip event occurred three days later and several kilometers to the northwest that also caused damage and one additional death. Because of the earthquake activity in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area, buildings and other public structures had been equipped with accelerometers, and both the mainshock and the primary aftershock provided additional data for seismologists to analyze and compare with other southern California events.
The 1988 Armenian earthquake, also known as the Spitak earthquake (Armenian: Սպիտակի երկրաշարժ Spitaki yerkrašarž) occurred in the northern region of Armenia (then part of the Soviet Union) on December 7 at 11:41 local time (07:41 UTC). The earthquake measured 6.8 on the surface wave magnitude scale and had a maximum perceived intensity of X (Devastating) on the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale. The region that the earthquake occurred is vulnerable to occasional large and destructive earthquakes and is part of a larger active seismic belt that stretches from the Alps to the Himalayas. Activity in the area is associated with tectonic plate boundary interaction and the source of the event was a slip of a thrust fault just to the north of Spitak.Seismologists thoroughly studied the effects of the Spitak event, including the mainshock and aftershock fault rupture mechanisms and were on site setting up temporary seismometers before the end of 1988. Earthquake engineering experts scrutinized building construction styles and found fault in the poorly constructed apartments and other buildings that were built during the Era of Stagnation under the rule of Leonid Brezhnev. The cities of Spitak, Leninakan (Gyumri), and Kirovakan (Vanadzor) were greatly affected with large losses of life and devastating effects to buildings and other structures. A number of the smaller outlying villages away from the larger population centers were also severely affected.Despite the tensions of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help within a few days of the earthquake, the first such request since World War II. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies, but private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had a large part of the international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel and a transport plane from Yugoslavia were both destroyed in separate incidents. In support of the relief effort, recording artists united to produce several music-related contributions for the victims of the quake. A song was produced by a duo of French composers (including Charles Aznavour) and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from the Rock Aid Armenia effort by the British music industry.
The 1988 Nepal earthquake occurred in Nepal near the Indian border and affected much of northern Bihar. The magnitude 6.9 earthquake shook the region on August 21, killing at least 709 persons and injuring thousands. The earthquake struck in two installments of 10 seconds and 15 seconds each and left cracks in 50,000 buildings, including Raj Bhavan and the old Secretariat Building in Patna, Bihar.
The 1988 Saguenay earthquake struck Quebec, Canada with a moment magnitude of 5.9 on November 25. It is one of the largest recorded earthquakes in eastern Canada and eastern North America during the 20th century.The earthquake was triggered by faults associated with the Saguenay Graben.
The 1989 Chenoua earthquake occurred on October 29 at 19:09:15 local time in northern Algeria. The dip-slip event had a moment magnitude of 5.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). At least 22 were killed and many were injured with total losses of $5 million.
The 1989 West Papua earthquake struck West Papua, Indonesia – then Irian Jaya province – on August 1 with a moment magnitude of 6.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Around 120 people were killed, mainly due to landslides and mudslides.
The 1989 Gissar earthquake occurred at 23:02 UTC on 22 January near Gissar in Tajikistan. The shock had a body wave magnitude of 5.3 and a maximum felt intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The National Geophysical Data Center reported that the death toll from the event amounted to about 274, while the National Earthquake Information Center stated there were many injured. This was the deadliest earthquake in 1989.
The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred in Northern California on October 17 at 5:04 p.m. local time. The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park approximately 10 mi (16 km) northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. With a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.Damage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County, but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland. No surface faulting occurred, though a large number of other ground failures and landslides occurred, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed.Due to the sports coverage of the 1989 World Series, it became the first major earthquake in the United States that was broadcast live on national television (and is sometimes referred to as the "World Series earthquake" as a result). Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal due to nearly 62,000 people present at the game at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures. The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the single largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, Los Altos, and Santa Cruz.
The 1989 Malawi earthquake occurred on March 10 with a moment magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). At least nine people were killed, 100 were injured, and about 50,000 were left homeless. There was damage was in the Salima-Dedza-Mchinji area, and it was felt strongly in much of central Malawi, the Niassa and Tete Provinces of Mozambique, and parts of Zambia.
The 1989 Newcastle earthquake occurred in Newcastle, New South Wales on Thursday, 28 December. The shock measured 5.6 on the Richter magnitude scale and was one of Australia's most serious natural disasters, killing 13 people and injuring more than 160. The damage bill has been estimated at A$4 billion (including an insured loss of about $1 billion).The effects were felt over an area of around 200,000 square kilometres (77,000 sq mi) in the state of New South Wales, with isolated reports of movement in areas up to 800 kilometres (500 mi) from Newcastle. Damage to buildings and facilities was reported over an area of 9,000 km2 (3,500 sq mi).
The 1989 Ungava earthquake occurred at 09:24 local time (14:24 UTC) on December 25 to the north of Lac Bécard in a remote part of the Ungava Peninsula in northern Quebec. It had a magnitude of 6.3 on the surface wave magnitude scale and 6.2–6.5 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of only IV (Light) on the Mercalli intensity scale, due to its remoteness from any inhabited areas. The mainshock was preceded by a magnitude 5.1 foreshock ten hours earlier. It was the first earthquake in eastern North America known to be associated with ground rupture.
Earthquakes in 1990 details the major earthquakes that occurred around the world in the year 1990.
The 1990 Vrancea earthquakes were three earthquakes on 30 and 31 May 1990 measuring 6.7 and 6.1 on Richter scale, that struck the Romanian county of Vrancea, on two consecutive days. Severe damage in the Bucharest-Brăila-Brașov area was reported and dozens of casualties in Romania and neighbouring Moldova, Ukraine and Bulgaria.The seismic doublet of May 1990 consisted of two mainshocks occurred at a distance of only 13 hours. The first mainshock took place in the afternoon of 30 May 1990, at 13:40:06 (local hour). The epicenter was located in the northeastern part of the Vrancea Mountains (45.9°N 26.9°E﻿ / 45.9; 26.9), at a depth of 89 km. The earthquake had a magnitude of MGR = 6.7 or Mw = 6.9, the intensity in the epicentral area being of VIII degrees on the Mercalli intensity scale, and VII degrees in Bucharest. On the morning of 31 May 1990, at 3:17 (local hour), occurred the second mainshock, at a depth of 79–86 km, having the magnitude MGR = 6.1 or Mw = 6.3. The event was felt in the epicentral area with an intensity of VII degrees on the Mercalli intensity scale, and VI degrees in Bucharest; likewise, the quake was felt strong enough in Dobrogea.In the USGS EXPO-CAT database it is estimated that during this earthquake 355,000 people were exposed to intensity VII, of which around 61% were in rural areas.
The 1990 Bishop's Castle earthquake occurred near the town of Bishop's Castle, Shropshire, England on 2 April.
The 1990 Luzon earthquake occurred on July 16 at 4:26 p.m. local time on the densely populated island of Luzon in the Philippines. The shock had a surface wave magnitude of 7.8 and produced a 125 km-long ground rupture that stretched from Dingalan, Aurora to Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija. The event was a result of strike-slip movements along the Philippine Fault and the Digdig Fault within the Philippine Fault System. The earthquake's epicenter was near the town of Rizal, Nueva Ecija, northeast of Cabanatuan City. An estimated 1,621 people were killed, most of the fatalities located in Central Luzon and the Cordillera region.
The 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake occurred on June 21 at 00:30:14 local time in northern Iran. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.4 and a Mercalli Intensity of X (Extreme). Widespread damage occurred to the northwest of the capital city of Tehran, including the cities of Rudbar and Manjil. The National Geophysical Data Center estimated that $8 billion in damage occurred in the affected area. Other earthquake catalogs presented estimates of the loss of life in the range of 35,000–50,000, with a further 60,000–105,000 that were injured.
The 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake occurred on June 28 at 07:43:55 local time with a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very Strong). The thrust earthquake resulted in two deaths, around 100 injuries, and damage estimated at $33.5–40 million. The event occurred beneath the San Gabriel Mountains on the Clamshell–Sawpit Fault, which is a part of the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System. Instruments captured the event at a number of strong motion stations in Southern California, including the two largest aftershocks (both 4.0 local magnitude) that occurred on June 28 and on July 6.
The 1991 Costa Rica earthquake, also known as Limon earthquake or Bocas del Toro earthquake, occurred at 3:57 pm local time (21:56:51 UTC) on April 22, 1991. The epicenter of the 7.8 Mw earthquake was in Pandora, Valle La Estrella, in the Caribbean region of Limon, Costa Rica, 225 kilometres (140 mi) southeast of San José. The earthquake was the strongest recorded in Costa Rica's history, and was felt throughout the country as well as in western Panama.
Striking the sea adjacent to Timor on July 4, the 1991 Kalabahi earthquakes left twenty three people dead and injured 181. Taking place about two-and-a-half seconds apart, the earthquakes measured 6.9 on the Richter magnitude scale.
The 1991 Racha earthquake occurred in the province of Racha, Georgia, at 9:12 UTC on 29 April. Centered on the districts of Oni and Ambrolauri on the southern foothills of the Greater Caucasus mountains, it killed 270, left approximately 100,000 homeless and caused severe damage, including to several medieval monuments. It had a magnitude of 7.0 and was the most powerful earthquake recorded in the Caucasus.
The 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake occurred on 20 October 1991 in the Uttarkashi and Gharwal regions of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.
The 1992 Big Bear earthquake occurred at 08:05:33 PDT on June 28 in Big Bear Lake, California, with a moment magnitude of 6.5 and a maximum perceived intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. The earthquake occurred at a relatively shallow depth of 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) and caused landslides in the San Bernardino Mountains.This earthquake occurred three hours after the 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake, which was centered 22 miles (35 km) to the east. The closely timed occurrence of these earthquakes is an often-cited example of a regional earthquake sequence. Both earthquakes had occurred significantly close to the southern portion of the San Andreas Fault, and the Landers event may have reduced the compressional stress in that area.
The 1992 Cairo earthquake occurred at 15:09 local time (13:09 UTC) on 12 October, with an epicenter near Dahshur, 35 km (22 mi) south of Cairo. The earthquake had a magnitude of 5.8, but was unusually destructive for its size, causing 545 deaths, injuring 6,512 and making 50,000 people homeless. It was the most damaging seismic event to affect Cairo since 1847.
The 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquakes (or 1992 Petrolia earthquakes) occurred along the Lost Coast of Northern California on April 25 and 26. The three largest events were the M7.2 thrust mainshock that struck near the unincorporated community of Petrolia midday on April 25 and two primary strike-slip aftershocks measuring 6.5 and 6.6 that followed early the next morning. The sequence encompassed both interplate and intraplate activity that was associated with the Mendocino Triple Junction, a complex system of three major faults (including the Cascadia subduction zone, San Andreas Fault, and Mendocino Fracture Zone) that converge near Cape Mendocino. The total number of aftershocks that followed the events exceeded 2,000.The three shocks damaged and destroyed homes and businesses in Humboldt County and injured 356 people, but the single largest loss was due to a post-earthquake fire that consumed a business center in Scotia. Accelerometers that had been in place in the Cape Mendocino area since the late 1970s recorded the event and the readings were moderate to strong, with the exception of the instruments closest to the epicenter, which went off scale a few seconds into the recording. No surface ruptures were present in the epicentral area, but landslides closed roads and railroad tracks for at least a week while cleanup took place. Also discovered was about 1 m (3 ft 3 in) of coastal uplift near Cape Mendocino and Punta Gorda.As the largest earthquake in California since the 1989 Loma Prieta event several years earlier, the mainshock caused a non-destructive tsunami that quickly reached the coast, and eventually Alaska and Hawaii several hours later. The tsunami was significant not because of its run-up, but because of the speed with which it reached the coast and for how long the waves persisted. Other strong earthquakes have affected the same area, with some that were clearly associated with the (interplate) Mendocino Fracture Zone, and others (like the two shocks on April 26) were intraplate earthquakes that ruptured within the Gorda Plate, but events that are unequivocally associated with the Cascadia subduction zone are very infrequent.
On 13 March, the 1992 Erzincan earthquake struck eastern Turkey with a moment magnitude of 6.7 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). Originating on the North Anatolian Fault, it rocked the country, leaving at least 498 people dead, roughly 2,000 injured, and an unknown amount missing. Total financial losses amounted to $13.5 million (American dollars).
The 1992 Flores earthquake occurred on December 12 on the island of Flores in Indonesia. With a magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe), it was the largest and also the deadliest earthquake in 1992.
The 1992 Landers earthquake occurred on June 28 with an epicenter near the town of Landers, California. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.3 and was the largest earthquake to have occurred in the contiguous United States in 40 years.
The 1992 Nicaragua earthquake occurred off the coast of Nicaragua at 6:16 p.m. on September 2. Some damage was also reported in Costa Rica. At least 116 people were killed and several more were injured. The quake was located in an active zone of stress and deformation. It created tsunamis disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude.
The 1992 Roermond earthquake occurred on 13 April, around 3:20 AM (1:20 UTC) with a moment magnitude of 5.3 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). Striking on the Peel Boundary Fault, a normal fault near Roermond, it was the strongest recorded earthquake in the Netherlands and in Northwestern Europe, and caused substantial damage to older buildings in the Netherlands and adjacent countries of Belgium and Germany. A series of aftershocks followed.
The 1992 Suusamyr earthquake occurred at 02:04 UTC on 19 August near Toluk in the border area of Kyrgyzstan. The shock had a surface wave magnitude of 7.5 and a maximum felt intensity of IX (Violent) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It was a result of reverse faulting. The death toll from the event amounted to about 75, including 14 people who were killed by landslides.
The 1993 Guam earthquake occurred on August 8 at 18:34:26 local time with a moment magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The thrust earthquake generated a non-destructive tsunami, left up to people 71 injured, and inflicted about $250 million in damage on Guam.
The 1993 southwest-off Hokkaido earthquake (北海道南西沖地震, Hokkaidō Nansei Oki Jishin) occurred at 13:17:12 UTC on 12 July 1993 in the Sea of Japan near the island of Hokkaido. It had a magnitude of 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum felt intensity of VIII (Severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It triggered a major tsunami that caused deaths on Hokkaidō and in southeastern Russia, with a total of 230 fatalities recorded. The island of Okushiri was hardest hit, with 165 casualties from the earthquake, the tsunami and a large landslide.
The 1993 Klamath Falls earthquakes took place in Klamath Falls, Oregon, beginning on Monday, 20 September at 8:28 p.m. The doublet earthquake registered respective magnitudes of 6.0 and 5.9 on the moment magnitude scale. The earthquakes were located at a depth of 5.6 miles (9 km) and tremors continued to be felt more than three months after the initial shocks.
The 1993 Latur earthquake struck India at 3:56 am local time (UTC+05:30) on 30 September. The main area affected was Maharashtra State in Western India. The earthquake primarily affected the districts of Latur and Osmanabad, including the Ausa block of Latur and Umerga of Osmanabad. Fifty-two villages were demolished in the intraplate earthquake. It measured 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale, and approximately 10,000 people died, whilst another 30,000 were injured. The earthquake's hypocenter was around 10 km deep – relatively shallow – allowing shock waves to cause more damage.Because the location does not lie on a plate boundary, there was some debate as to what caused the earthquake. One suggestion is the existence of fault webs. The Indian sub-continent crumples as it pushes against Asia and pressure is released. It is possible that this pressure is released along fault lines. Another argument is that reservoir construction along the Terna was responsible for increasing pressure on fault lines. Killari, where the epicenter of the quake is believed to have been, had a large crater, which remains in place to date.
The 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake, also known as the "Spring break quake", occurred in the U.S. state of Oregon on March 25 at 5:34 AM Pacific Standard Time. With a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum perceived intensity of VII (Very strong) on the Mercalli intensity scale, it was the largest earthquake in the Pacific Northwest since the Elk Lake and Goat Rocks earthquakes of 1981. Ground motion was widely felt in Oregon's Willamette Valley, the Portland metropolitan area, and as far north as the Puget Sound area near Seattle, Washington.
The 1994 Kuril Islands earthquake occurred on October 4, 1994 at 13:22 UTC (October 5, 1994 at 00:22 local time). The magnitude of this earthquake was put at Mw 8.2, or Mj 8.1. The epicenter was located at about 70 km east of the Shikotan Island. This earthquake triggered a tsunami in southern Kuril Islands and Hokkaido. The tsunami run-up height was more than 3 m in Yuzhno-Kurilsk bay and 5 m in Zelenyi Island, Russia. A peak-to-trough tsunami wave height of 346 cm was recorded in Hanasaki, Japan. The shaking and tsunami caused road and building damage. At least 10 people were reported dead. The intensity was MSK VI~IX in Shikotan Island. Oil storage tanks in Malokurilsk and Krabozavodsk were damaged. An oil leak occurred and causing heavy contamination of the port area. The earthquake could be felt in Tokyo with shindo 3, and in Hokkaido, the highest intensity reached shindo 6. This earthquake was an intra-slab earthquake within the Pacific Plate which is subducting beneath the Okhotsk Plate. A numerical simulation of the tsunami suggested that the first wave was caused by a significant subsidence north of the Kuril Islands due to the earthquake.A large aftershock of magnitude Mw 7.1 or Ms 7.7 occurred on October 9, 1994 at 07:55 UTC.

At least 12 people were killed and 40 injured in the earthquakes of January 21. Another earthquake on March 1, 1997 at 14:04 local time with magnitude Ms6.0 killed another person. On April 6, 6, 11, 16, other four earthquakes with magnitudes Ms 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.3 killed 8 people. Several predictions were made in this earthquake series. Some of the predictions were not fulfilled, while some preceded the predicted earthquake from 2.5 hours to 4 days. The April 11 earthquake occurred 30 minutes after a prediction was made.
The 1997 Kamchatka earthquake, or 1997 Kronotsky earthquake, occurred on December 5 at 11:26 UTC near the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is an Mw 7.7 (7.6-7.8) earthquake and was felt with intensity MM V in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. A 60 cm (23.6 in) tsunami was recorded in Kahului, 47 cm (18.5 in.) in Hilo, and 15 cm (6 in.) in Unalaska. The local tsunami generated by this earthquake affected a mostly unpopulated region. A post-tsunami survey found runup (height above normal sea level) on the Kronotsky Peninsula was no more than a few meters. However, a later geological survey north of the peninsula, as well as an interview with a park ranger, indicate that runup was up to 8 meters (26 ft) along the coast near the Little and Big Chazhma rivers and north to the Storozh River.Deformation during and after this earthquake was measured by GPS. There were significant foreshocks, and also an apparently independent rupture along the southern border of the primary rupture.
The 1997 Manyi earthquake (玛尼地震) occurred on November 8 at 10:02 UTC. The epicenter was in Nagqu Prefecture (那曲地區) in northern Tibet, China. The focal mechanism indicates a lift-lateral strike-slip movement. This earthquake had a surface rupture of 17 km (11 mi) long with up to 7 m (23 ft) of left-lateral slip along the Manyi fault, a westward continuation of the Kunlun fault, offset about 100 km (62 mi) to the south. Normally, the continental crust is about 35 km (22 mi) thick, but it reaches 70 km (43 mi) thick under the Tibetan Plateau. This earthquake ruptured up to 20 km (12 mi) of the top part of the local continental crust.
The 1997 Punitaqui earthquake occurred at 01:03 UTC on October 15. It had an estimated magnitude of 7.1. This earthquake was one of the most destructive in the epicentral area compared to other events of subduction of the same size. The extensive damage to structures was the result of an amplification effect on the ground and the poor quality of building materials, this reflects the potential for damage incurred in an intraplate earthquake with vertical fault and how it can be much greater than what which can cause one of interplate of similar magnitude, and caused severe damage in Chilean cities of La Serena, Ovalle, Illapel and Punitaqui.
The Qayen earthquake, also known as the Ardekul or Qaen earthquake, struck Northern Iran's Khorasan Province on May 10, 1997 at 07:57 UTC (12:57 local time). The largest in the area since 1990, the earthquake measured 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale and was centered approximately 270 kilometers (170 mi) south of Mashhad on the village of Ardekul. The third earthquake that year to cause severe damage, it devastated the Birjand–Qayen region, killing 1,567 and injuring more than 2,300. The earthquake—which left 50,000 homeless and damaged or destroyed over 15,000 homes—was described as the deadliest of 1997 by the United States Geological Survey. Some 155 aftershocks caused further destruction and drove away survivors. The earthquake was later discovered to have been caused by a rupture along a fault that runs underneath the Iran–Afghanistan border.Damage was eventually estimated at $100 million, and many countries responded to the emergency with donations of blankets, tents, clothing, and food. Rescue teams were also dispatched to assist local volunteers in finding survivors trapped under the debris. The destruction around the earthquake's epicenter was, in places, almost total; this has been attributed to poor construction practices in rural areas, and imparted momentum to a growing movement for changes in building codes. With 1 in 3,000 deaths in Iran attributable to earthquakes, a US geophysicist has suggested that a country-wide rebuilding program would be needed to address the ongoing public safety concerns.
The 1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake occurred in the regions of Umbria and Marche, central Italy on the morning of September 26. It was preceded by a foreshock almost as strong as the main quake.

In 1999, the former Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (海洋科学技術センター) (Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) (海洋研究開発機構) after 2004) conducted an investigation in the region of the source of this earthquake.The source of this earthquake was a sinistral (left-lateral) strike-slip fault. It was an intra-plate earthquake inside the Philippine Sea Plate. Such large intra-plate earthquakes inside the Philippine Sea Plate are not very common in this region. This earthquake was the strongest intra-plate earthquake inside the Philippine Sea Plate in the Ryukyu Islands region in 100 years as it occurred.
The 1999 Aïn Témouchent earthquake occurred on December 22 at 18:36:56 local time in northern Algeria. The dip-slip event had a moment magnitude of 5.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). At least 22 were killed, 175 were injured, and 15,000 were homeless. The Belgian Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters' EM-DAT database and the USGS' National Geophysical Data Center both list financial losses of $60.93 million.
The 1999 Ambrym earthquake occurred on November 26 at 00:21:17 local time with a moment magnitude of 7.4 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The back arc thrust event occurred within the Vanuatu archipelago, just to the south of the volcanic island of Ambrym. Vanuatu, which was previously known as New Hebrides, is subject to volcanic and earthquake activity because it lies on an active and destructive plate boundary called the New Hebrides Subduction Zone. While the National Geophysical Data Center classified the total damage as moderate, a destructive local tsunami did result in some deaths, with at least five killed and up to 100 injured.This was one of very few events along the New Hebrides Subduction Zone that has been studied. Scientists from technical institutes in the region submitted papers to the scientific journals about the event, and while not all data on each of the aspects of the event are in agreement, what is certain is that the d'Entrecasteaux Ridge is producing unusual effects where it infringes into the subduction zone via the Indo-Australian Plate.
The Jiji earthquake (Chinese: 集集大地震; pinyin: Jíjí dàdìzhèn), known locally as the 921 earthquake (Chinese: 九二一大地震; pinyin: Jiǔ'èryī dàdìzhèn), was a 7.3 Ms or 7.6-7.7 Mw earthquake which occurred in Jiji, Nantou County, Taiwan on Tuesday, 21 September 1999 at 01:47:12.6 TST (Monday, 20 September 1999 at 17:47:12.6 UTC). 2,415 people were killed, 11,305 injured, and NT$300 billion (US$10 billion) worth of damage was done. It was the second-deadliest quake in recorded history in Taiwan, after the 1935 Hsinchu-Taichu earthquake.Rescue groups from around the world joined local relief workers and the ROC military in digging out survivors, clearing rubble, restoring essential services and distributing food and other aid to the more than 100,000 people made homeless by the quake. The disaster, dubbed the "Quake of the Century" by local media, had a profound effect on the economy of the island and the consciousness of the people, and dissatisfaction with government's performance in reacting to it was said by some commentators to be a factor in the unseating of the ruling Kuomintang party in the 2000 presidential election.
The 1999 Armenia, Colombia earthquake occurred on 25 January at 13:19 with an epicenter 25 miles (40 km) west south west of Ibagué, Colombia. The shock heavily affected the city of Armenia, Colombia in the Quindío department, and about 18 other towns and 28 additional villages in the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis region departments, and to a lesser degree, the cities of Pereira and Manizales. The earthquake had a magnitude of 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale and was the strongest earthquake to strike Colombia for 16 years.
The 1999 Athens earthquake, registering a moment magnitude of 6.0, occurred on September 7 at 2:56:50 pm local time and lasted approximately 15 seconds in Ano Liosia. The tremor was epicentered approximately 17 km to the northwest of the city center, in a sparsely populated area between the working-class town of Acharnes and the Mount Parnitha National Park. This proximity to the Athens Metropolitan Area resulted in widespread structural damage, mainly to the nearby towns of Ano Liossia, Acharnes, Fyli and Thrakomakedones as well as to the northern Athenian suburbs of Kifissia, Metamorfosi, Kamatero and Nea Philadelphia. More than 100 buildings (including three major factories) across those areas collapsed trapping scores of victims under their rubble while dozens more were severely damaged. Overall, 143 people lost their lives and more than 2,000 were treated for injuries in what eventually became Greece's deadliest natural disaster in almost half a century. This event took Greek seismologists by surprise as it came from a previously unknown fault, originating in an area that was for a long time considered of a particularly low seismicity. The highest recorded peak ground acceleration was 0.3g, at 15 km from the epicentre, with attenuation predicting 0.6g acceleration at the centre.
The 1999 Chamoli earthquake occurred on 28 March 1999 in the Chamoli district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (now in Uttarakhand). The earthquake was the strongest to hit the foothills of the Himalayas in more than ninety years. Approximately 103 people died in the earthquake.
The 1999 Düzce earthquake occurred on 12 November at 18.57 local time (16.57 UTC) with a moment magnitude of 7.2, causing damage and 894 fatalities in Duzce, Turkey. The epicenter was approx. 100 km (62 mi) to the east of the moment magnitude 7.4 1999 İzmit earthquake of 17 August 1999, which killed over 17,000 people. The earthquake occurred on the North Anatolian Fault.
The 1999 Hector Mine earthquake occurred on October 16 at 02:46:44 PDT with a moment magnitude of 7.1 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe). The strike-slip earthquake occurred in a remote part of the Mojave Desert, 47 miles (76 km) east-southeast of Barstow, California, inside the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Base. Its name comes from a nearby quarry named Hector Mine, which is located 22 kilometers (14 mi) northwest of the epicenter.
The 1999 İzmit earthquake (also known as the Kocaeli, Gölcük, or Marmara earthquake) occurred on 17 August at 03:01:40 local time in northwestern Turkey. The shock had a moment magnitude of 7.6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The event lasted for 37 seconds, killing around 17,000 people and left approximately half a million people homeless. The nearby city of İzmit was very badly damaged.
The 1999 Oaxaca earthquake occurred on September 30 at 11:31 local time (16:31 UTC) in Oaxaca, Mexico, 60 km NNW of Puerto Ángel. The epicenter was located near San Agustin Loxicha. It had a magnitude of Mw 7.4. The maximum intensity reached MM VIII in southwestern Oaxaca, and could be felt strongly in Mexico City. The torrential rains preceding and following the temblor intensified the damage of this earthquake. 35 people were reported dead. The archeological site of the ancient Zapotec city of Monte Alban also suffered damage in this earthquake. This was an intraplate earthquake in the Cocos Plate, with a normal-faulting mechanism. The fault plane was 90 km long and 45 km wide. The maximum slip was about 2.5 m, which was located about 20 and 40 km WNW of the hypocenter. A research of M. A. Dunajecka and S. A. Pulinets showed that anomalies in temperature and humidity had been observed before the earthquake.
The 1999 Tehuacán earthquake, or the 1999 Central Mexico earthquake, occurred on June 15 at 15:42 local time (20:42 UTC) near Tehuacán, Puebla, Mexico, close to the state of Oaxaca. The earthquake measured 7.0 on the moment magnitude scale.
